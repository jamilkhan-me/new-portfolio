## Important quotes

- **Chapter One - How Genes Really Work**
  - Talent is not a thing; it’s a process.
  - Height can provide a terrific insight into the gene-environment dynamic. Most of us think of height as being more or less directly genetically determined. The reality is so much more interesting. One of the most striking early hints of the new understanding of development as a dynamic process emerged in 1957 when Stanford School of Medicine researcher William Walter Greulich measured the heights of Japanese children raised in California and compared them to the heights of Japanese children raised in Japan during the same time period. The California-raised kids, with significantly better nourishment and medical care, grew an astonishing five inches taller on average.
  - Genes do not, on their own, make us smart, dumb, sassy, polite, depressed, joyful, musical, tone-deaf, athletic, clumsy, literary, or incurious. Those characteristics come from a complex interplay within a dynamic system. Every day in every way you are helping to shape which genes become active. Your life is interacting with your genes.
  - Dynamic development is the new paradigm for talent, lifestyle, and well-being. It is how genes influence everything but strictly determine very little. It forces us to rethink everything about ourselves, where we come from, and where we can go. It promises that while we’ll never have true control over our lives, we do have the power to impact them enormously. Dynamic development is why human biology is a jukebox with many potential tunes—not specific built-in instructions for a certain kind of life, but built-in capacity for a variety of possible lives. No one is genetically doomed to mediocrity. Dynamic development was one of the big ideas of the twentieth century, and remains so. Once our brand-new parents in University Hospital understand its implications for their newborn girl, it will affect how they live, how they parent, and even how they vote.
- **Chapter Two - Intelligence Is a Process, Not a Thing**
  - Intelligence is not an innate aptitude, hardwired at conception or in the womb, but a collection of developing skills driven by the interaction between genes and environment. No one is born with a predetermined amount of intelligence. Intelligence (and IQ scores) can be improved. Few adults come close to their true intellectual potential. \[Some\] assert that an individual’s intelligence is a fixed quantity which cannot be increased. We must protest and react against this brutal pessimism.
  - conducted MRI scans on London cabbies and compared them with the brain scans of others. In contrast with noncabbies, experienced taxi drivers had a greatly enlarged posterior hippocampus—that part of the brain that specializes in recalling spatial representations.
  - This is our famous “plasticity”: every human brain’s built-in capacity to become, over time, what we demand of it. Plasticity does not mean that we’re all born with the exact same potential. Of course we are not. But it does guarantee that no ability is fixed. And as it turns out, plasticity makes it virtually impossible to determine any individual’s true intellectual limitations, at any age.
  - Hart and Risley also found that, in the first four years after birth, the average child from a professional family receives 560,000 more instances of encouraging feedback than discouraging feedback; a working-class child receives merely 100,000 more encouragements than discouragements; a welfare child receives 125,000 more discouragements than encouragements.
  - Why do some kids do better in school right from the start? Why are they earlier talkers, earlier achievers, and ultimately more creatively and financially successful in their adult lives? It’s because from day one, they are trained to be.
  - intelligence isn’t fixed. Intelligence isn’t general. Intelligence is not a thing. Intelligence is a dynamic, diffuse, and ongoing process. This finding fits perfectly with the earlier work of Mihály Csikszentmihályi and colleagues, who concluded that “high academic achievers are not necessarily born ‘smarter’ than others, but work harder and develop more self-discipline.”
- **Chapter Three - The End of Giftedness and the True Source of Talent**
  - Like intelligence, talents are not innate gifts, but the result of a slow, invisible accretion of skills developed from the moment of conception. Everyone is born with differences, and some with unique advantages for certain tasks. But no one is genetically designed into greatness and few are biologically restricted from attaining it.
  - In the twentieth century, the presumed source of a person’s natural endowment shifted from God-given to gene-given, but the basic notion of giftedness remained substantially the same. Exceptional abilities were things bestowed upon a very lucky person.
  - For deliberate practice to work, the demands have to be serious and sustained. Simply playing lots of chess or soccer or golf isn’t enough. Simply taking lessons from a wonderful teacher is not enough. Simply wanting it badly enough is not enough. Deliberate practice requires a mind-set of never, ever, being satisfied with your current ability. It requires a constant self-critique, a pathological restlessness, a passion to aim consistently just beyond one’s capability so that daily disappointment and failure is actually desired, and a never-ending resolve to dust oneself off and try again and again and again.
  - Conventional nature-versus-nurture wisdom says very few people, but the clear and exciting lesson from GxE and from Anders Ericsson’s research is this: no one knows. We do not—and cannot—know our own limits unless and until we push ourselves to them. Finding one’s true natural limit in any field takes many years and many thousands of hours of intense pursuit.
- **Chapter Four - The Similarities and Dissimilarities of Twins**
  - “Since personality is heritable …” (New York Times) “In some significant ways … criminals are born, not made.”
  - twin studies reveal that intelligence is 60 percent “heritable,” which implies that 60 percent of each person’s intelligence comes preset from genes while the remaining 40 percent gets shaped by the environment.
- **Chapter Five - Prodigies and Late Bloomers**
  - It is critical to note that the damage does not create the ability; rather, it creates the opportunity for the ability to develop.
- **Chapter Six - Can White Men Jump? Ethnicity, Genes, Culture, and Success**
  - Keino mentioned, Kalenjin kids tend to run long distances as a practical matter, an average of eight to twelve kilometers per day from age seven.
  - The reality of GxE assures that each person’s genes interact with his climate, altitude, culture, meals, language, customs, and spirituality—everything—to produce unique life trajectories. Genes play a critical role, but as dynamic instruments, not a fixed blueprint. A seven- or fourteen- or twenty-eight-year-old outfitted with a certain height, shape, muscle-fiber proportion, and so on is not that way merely because of genetic instruction.
  - John Manners’s depiction of cattle-raiding Kenyans becoming genetically selected to be better and better runners over the generations,
  - The record speed for the mile, for example, was cut from 4:36 in 1865 to 3:43 in 1999. The one-hour cycling distance record increased from 26 kilometers in 1876 to 49 kilometers in 2005. The 200-meter freestyle swimming record decreased from 2:31 in 1908 to 1:43 in 2007. Technology and aerodynamics are a part of the story, but the rest of it has to do with training intensity, training methods, and sheer competitiveness and desire. It used to be that 67 kilometers per week was considered an aggressive level of training. Today’s serious Kenyan runners, Noakes points out, will cover 230 kilometers per week (at 6,000 feet in altitude). These are not superhumans with rare super-genes. They are participants in a culture of the extreme, willing to devote more, to ache more, and to risk more in order to do better. Most of us will understandably want nothing to do with that culture of the extreme. But that is our choice.
- **Chapter Seven - How to Be a Genius (or Merely Great)**
  - The old nature/nurture paradigm suggests that control over our lives is divided between genes (nature) and our own decisions (nurture). In fact, we have far more control over our genes—-and far less control over our environment—-than we think.
  - We theoretically choose what we eat, but in reality almost all of us conform to established cultural norms—we eat what our family eats, what our friends and neighbors eat, what our local community eats, what our nation eats. The same principle applies to our language and idioms, to the information and entertainment we consume, our kids’ schools and activities, the art and aesthetics we’re surrounded by, the people we spend our time with, the basic philosophical notions we subscribe to, and even the air, water, and physical environment that surround us. Even in a land of free choice, we are mostly shaped by habits, messages, schedules, expectations, social infrastructure, and natural surroundings that are not exclusively our own. Many of these elements are passed down from generation to generation with little or no change and are difficult or impossible to alter.
  - The strong temptation will always be to revert back to the nature/nurture paradigm: if it’s not nature, it must be nurture. If it’s not genes, it must be environment. If it’s not DNA, it must be parenting.
  - The single greatest lesson from past ultra-achievers is not how easily things came to them, but how irrepressible and resilient they were. You have to want it, want it so bad you will never give up, so bad that you are ready to sacrifice time, money, sleep, friendships, even your reputation (people may—probably will—come to think of you as odd). You will have to adopt a particular lifestyle of ambition, not just for a few weeks or months but for years and years and years. You have to want it so bad that you are not only ready to fail, but you actually want to experience failure: revel in it, learn from it. It’s impossible to say for how long you will have to do these things. You cannot know the results in advance. Uncommon achievement requires an uncommon level of personal motivation and a massive amount of faith.
  - In consumer culture, we are constantly conditioned to gratify our impulses immediately: buy, eat, watch, click—now. High achievers transcend these impulses.
  - Heroes inspire, not just by their great work but also by their humble beginnings. Einstein worked as a patent clerk. Thomas Edison was expelled from the first grade because his teacher thought him retarded. Charles Darwin had so little to show for himself as a teenager that his father said to him, “You care for nothing but shooting, dogs, and rat-catching and you will be a disgrace to yourself and all your family.” (Just a few years later, young Darwin set out on the HMS Beagle and eventually revolutionized humanity’s view of itself.)
  - What would really be a lesson that everybody should learn is that … things come out of nothing. Things evolve out of nothing. The tiniest seed in the right situation turns into the most beautiful forest, and then, the most promising seed in the wrong situation turns into nothing …
  - I think this would be important for people to understand because it gives people confidence in their own lives to know that that’s how things work. If you walk around with the idea that there are some people who are so gifted, that they have these wonderful things in their head, but you’re not one of them, you’re just sort of … a “normal” person. \[But with this insight\], you could have another kind of life. You could say, “Well, I know that things come from nothing very much and start from unpromising beginnings, and I’m an unpromising beginning—I could start something.”
- **Chapter Eight - How to Ruin (or Inspire) a Kid**
  - Intelligence is not fixed but waiting to be developed.
  - talent is not inherent or inborn, but trained and educated …
  - gifts and talents, he was convinced, were not exclusive to the privileged few; with the right training and persistence, anyone could achieve remarkable success.
  - parent must not use affection as a reward for success or a punishment for failure. The parent must show faith in the child’s ability to seek achievement for his or her own inner satisfaction. 3.
  - persistence is the difference between mediocrity and enormous success.
  - The marshmallow study also demonstrated the ability to develop such skills. In side experiments, researchers transformed kids’ wait times by suggesting how to think of the rewards. When kids staring at real marshmallows were encouraged to imagine them as pictures of marshmallows—making them more abstract in their minds—it lengthened their ability to wait from six to eighteen minutes. (The reverse was also true—kids imagining pictures as real marshmallows had their waiting ability shortened.)
  - Model self-control. Behave as you’d want your child to behave, now and in the future. Don’t buy, eat, or grab whatever you want whenever you want it. The more self-control you demonstrate, the more your child will absorb. Give kids practice. Don’t immediately respond to their every plea. Let them learn to deal with frustration and want. Let them learn how to soothe themselves and discover that things will be all right if they wait for what they want.
  - In the sometimes counterintuitive world of success and achievement, weaknesses are opportunities; failures are wide-open doors. The only true failure is to give up or sell your children short.
- **Chapter Nine - How to Foster a Culture of Excellence**
  - humanity is a social and competitive enterprise. We learn from one another, share with one another, and constantly compare and compete with one another for affection, accomplishment, and resources.
  - Cultural differences matter enormously. In the seventh and eighth centuries, the Islamic Renaissance radiating from Baghdad sparked great advances in agriculture, economics, law, and literature. Mathematicians used spherical trigonometry and the new science of algebra to develop a more precise calculation of time, latitude and longitude, the earth’s surface area and circumference, and the location of the stars. Europe at the time had nothing like this same inventiveness; it would have to wait until the twelfth century for its analogous culture of innovation. (Among other developments, there were twelfth-century European advances in printing, timekeeping, astronomy, navigation, lenses, ships, and guns.)
  - In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, France revolutionized Western cooking with dramatic new sauces, soufflés, soups, and pastries, while nearby England rested with its sweet and savory meat pies. In the twenty-first century, the United States is home to eleven of the fifteen top-rated universities in the world; the entire African continent doesn’t have even one university in the top 150.
  - How do some cultures motivate superb achievement while others leave potential geniuses uninspired and inert? In his study of the ancient Greeks, Nietzsche imagined Plato declaring, “Only the contest made me a poet, a sophist, an orator!” Competition, Nietzsche observed, was central to that culture, where rivalries were encouraged not only in sports but also in oratory, drama, music, and politics. Other Greek historians concur. “The ancient Greeks turned competition into an institution on which they based the education of their citizens,” explains Olympic official Cleanthis Palaeologos. “They presented the victory at major games as a godsent blessing, a joy and pride for the city, its fame and prestige, and they recognised the victors as men worthy of respect and honoured them with great distinctions.”
  - Harvard psychologist Henry A. Murray proposed that human beings could be separated into two distinct competitive personalities: HAMs (“high in achievement motivation”) and LAMs (“low in achievement motivation”). HAMs enjoy and perform better under directly competitive conditions than they do under noncompetitive conditions. LAMs dislike competition, do not seek it out, and are less happy and productive when pushed into it. They do better when pursuing so-called mastery goals—improvement of a skill in comparison to oneself rather than to others.
  - List compared competitive instincts in two very different societies: Maasai in Tanzania and Khasi in India. Among the patriarchal Maasai, men choose to compete at twice the rate of women. But among the Khasi, which is rooted in a matrilineal culture where women inherit property and children are named from the mother’s side of the family, women choose to compete much more often than men.
  - The first point to take away from this study is that there is clearly no fixed male or female competitive biology. How men and women act is dependent on cultural circumstances and gene-environment interaction.
  - Our cultural landscape directly affects whether and how people challenge themselves and others to achieve.

  - The truth is, I do want my kids to dream big and to never give up. I can’t pick their dreams for them and wouldn’t dare try. But I can tell them, as my mother and father told me, that any dream is worth having and there’s no telling what you can do when you put your mind to it. The only difference between that generation and this one is that my parents were speaking from intuition, faith, and experience. I’m speaking from intuition, faith, experience, and science.
