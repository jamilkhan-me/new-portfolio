## Important quotes

- Bored where you are? Travel. Hate your job? Change it. Crave it? Have it. Think it? Say it. Want it? Buy it. Dream it? Chase it. Nearly anything you want, whenever you want it, however you’d like it,
- Technology, access, success, power, privilege— this is only a blessing when accompanied by the second of the cardinal virtues: self-restraint.
- Life is not fair. Gifts are not handed out evenly. And the reality of this inequity is that those of us coming from a disadvantage have to be even more disciplined to have a chance. They have to work harder, they have less room for error.
- “Most powerful is he who has himself in his own power.”
- driver without control will go fast … but they will inevitably crash.
- Morrison was also a single working mother of two young boys. Her job as an editor for Random House occupied her days, her children every other minute, and by the late evening she was burned out, too tired to think. It was the precious early morning hours between the parting dark and the rising dawn, before her boys uttered the word Mama, before the pile of manuscripts from work demanded her attention, before the commute, before the phone calls, before the bills beckoned, before the dishes needed to be done, it was then that she could be a writer.
- Early, she was free. Early, she was confident and clearheaded and full of energy. Early, the obligations of life existed only in theory and not in fact. All that mattered, all that was there, was the story—the inspiration and the art.
- Wake up. Show up. Be present. Give it everything you’ve got.
- The less you desire, the richer you are, the freer you are, the more powerful you are. It’s that simple.
- Robert Moses preferred to work off a large table, because it made him more effective and encouraged better workflow. Moses believed in processing: Something came in and he dealt with it. Mail, memos, reports—he didn’t let any of it sit, let alone pile up. “Since a table has no drawers,” Caro wrote of Moses’s system, “there was no place to hide papers; there was no escape from a nagging problem or a difficult-to-answer letter except to get rid of it in one way or another.”
- Be regular and orderly in your life, so that you may be violent and original in your work. Clean up your desk. Make your bed. Get your things in order. Now get after it.
- showing up. The incredible, underrated power of clocking in every day, putting your ass in the seat, and the luck this seems to inevitably produce. Edison lived in his laboratory and never missed a day—like Gehrig, even when he was sick, when he was tired, or when visited by tragedy or disaster.
- Once something is done, you can build on it. Once you get started, momentum can grow. When you show up, you can get lucky. Is this still hard? Yes. But the good news is that because it’s hard, most people don’t do it. They don’t show up. They can’t even do one tiny thing a day. So yes, you’re alone, out there on the track in the rain. You’re the only one responding on Christmas. But having the lead is, by definition, a little lonely. This is also why it’s quiet in the morning. You have the opportunities all to yourself. Don’t worry about setting any records … just report for duty. No excuses. And here’s the irony: This is also a way to break records! Consistency is a superpower.
- It’s easy to go fast. It is not always best. They like to say in the military that slow is smooth and smooth is fast.
- When you are not practicing, refining, working—somewhere, someone else is … and when you meet them, they will beat you.
- No matter what you do, practice will make you better. Florence Nightingale wanted young nurses to understand that nursing was an art that required “as hard a preparation as any painter or sculptor’s work.” Churchill spent many evenings practicing his “impromptu” performances. Only you know what it will look like to train in your art like a samurai, an Olympic athlete, a master in pursuit of excellence. Only you will know what you need to practice from morning until night, what to repeat ten thousand times.
- reporter once inquired why Merkel was so often seen in the same pantsuit—don’t you have anything else? “I am a civil servant,” Merkel replied, “not a model.”
- Maybe that’s why Steve Jobs picked out one comfortable sweater and a brand of jeans and stuck with them all his life. They weren’t cheap. They fit well. They worked in every situation. They were timelessly in style … and then he never thought about them again.
- We dress well … but not too well. We take care to take care of ourselves … but never at the neglect of the people or things in our care. We take our appearance seriously … without taking ourselves seriously. As they say in fashion circles, we wear the suit, the suit doesn’t wear us. We look sharp to stay sharp, to be sharp … because we are sharp.
- A person who understands the value of discipline. A person who is comfortable being uncomfortable. Go run a marathon. Sleep on the ground. Lift something heavy. Do the manual labor yourself. Jump in the cold lake.
- To last, to be great, you have to understand how to rest. Not just rest, but relax, too, have fun too. (After all, what kind of success is it if you can never lay it down?) The most surefire way to make yourself more fragile, to cut your career short, is to be undisciplined about rest and recovery, to push yourself too hard, too fast, to overtrain and to pursue the false economy of overwork. Manage the load.
- We say “I’m not a morning person,” but that is almost certainly because we have been an irresponsible or undisciplined evening person. The best way to master the morning is to have mastered it the night before.
- There is an old German word, sitzfleisch, which basically means sitting your butt in the chair and not getting up until the task is complete.
- Showing up yourself, day after day, until your back aches, your eyes water, and your limbs turn to mush. Many a great conqueror in the days of horseback were called “Old Iron Ass” for their ability to stay in the saddle.
- what we really need is commitment. What we need is a willingness to put our body where the problem is, throwing ourselves completely into solving it, to show that we are not for turning, that we will not be deterred.
- From the day of her coronation, Elizabeth would reign but not rule, as the expression goes, holding with perfect grace a unique and terrible job. What does the modern British sovereign do? It’s hard to say. It’s easier to list all the things they can’t do. She can’t pass laws. She can’t choose who leads the government. She can’t start wars. She’s not even supposed to speak about matters of policy. And yet the irony of this powerlessness is all the power required to wield it: The Queen has been duly informed of every action and problem inside the United Kingdom for sixty-nine years, in the form of daily dispatches and weekly conferences with the prime minister; at the same time, she is not allowed to overtly act on any of this information. She cannot, in any way whatsoever, involve herself in the matters of state … all of which is done literally in her name! This is precisely what Elizabeth has managed to do with near superhuman dignity through twelve prime ministers, fourteen US presidents, and seven popes. On her twenty-first birthday in 1947, the future queen would detail her commitment to this idea in a now-famous radio address, telling the people of what was then called the British Empire that “I declare before you all that my whole life whether it be long or short shall be devoted to your service and the service of our great imperial family to which we all belong.”
- Queen Elizabeth has worked every day for nearly seven decades! For her, every day has been game day, some twenty-five thousand in a row. She’s visited more than 126 nations. In 1953, on a single royal tour, she traveled forty thousand miles, many of which were by boat. She shook thirteen thousand hands and received tens of thousands of bows and curtsies. She gave and listened to over four hundred speeches. And this was just one of more than a hundred of these royal tours during her reign. In all, she’s traveled more than one million nautical miles by sea, and many times that by air. She’s met more than four million people (personally had more than two million over for tea) and given more than one hundred thousand awards. Perhaps most impressive, out of hundreds of thousands of engagements, events, appearances, and meals, which were often preceded by long-distance travel and time zone changes, she has fallen asleep in public only a single time … at a lecture about the use of magnets in biology and medicine in 2004.\*
- It goes without saying that the Queen’s regular duties take immense physical discipline. “Are you tired, general?” she once asked a noticeably drooping officer accompanying her on an official visit. “No, ma’am,” he replied. “Then take your hands out of your pockets and stand up straight,” she told him from her five-foot-four perch. Aides have noted that the Queen is as strong as a yak and can endure long periods of standing, even into old age. Harold Macmillan, her third prime minister, once exclaimed that the Queen had the “heart and stomach of a man,” which is preposterous because not even Lou Gehrig could have put up with her travel schedule.
- Discipline isn’t just endurance and strength. It’s also finding the best, most economical way of doing something. It’s the commitment to evolving and improving so that the tasks get more efficient as you go. A true master isn’t just dominating their profession, they’re also doing it with ease … while everyone else is still huffing and puffing.
- From her teens, she was advised by Churchill, and tutored twice per week for six years in law by one of England’s greatest constitutional experts.
- In almost every case, she is more experienced and understands the history of an issue better than the prime minister explaining it during their weekly audience.
- Discipline is a far rarer commodity at the top than brilliance.
- No one lasts very long if they are afraid of change, and few are able to change if they are afraid of feedback or making mistakes.
- ninety-five years old and still going. She has effectively and tirelessly served as head of state for roughly one-sixth of the Earth’s surface. She’s done so without personal corruption scandals, without affairs, without major missteps.

- Everything we say yes to means saying no to something else. No one can be two places at once. No one can give all their focus to more than one thing. But the power of this reality can also work for you: Every no can also be a yes, a yes to what really matters. To rebuff one opportunity means to cultivate another.
- This is the key not just to professional success but also personal happiness. When someone takes “just a few minutes of your time,” they aren’t just robbing you (though they admit this when they ask to “pick your brain” and thus your pocket). They’re also robbing your family. They’re robbing the people who you serve. They are robbing the future. The same goes for when you agree to do unimportant things, or when you commit to too much at one time. Except this time, you are the thief.
- No one can say yes to their destiny without saying no to what is clearly someone else’s. No one can achieve their main thing without the discipline to make it the main thing.
- to focus on one thing requires not focusing on other, less important things.
- “Patience serves as protection against wrongs as clothes do against cold.
- If things went exactly the way we wanted, if it didn’t demand discomfort and sacrifice and patient endurance, then no discipline would be required, and everyone would do it. Then the fruit wouldn’t just be less sweet—someone would have already eaten it.
- “because fear makes your mind sharper. When you have nothing to fear, your mind becomes dull.”
- Discipline is not a punishment, it’s a way to avoid punishment. We do it because we love ourselves, we value ourselves and what we do.
- Seek yourself, not distraction. Be happy, not hedonistic. Let the mind rule, not the body. Conquer pleasure, make yourself superior to pain.
- pointless scandals of Truman’s presidency were the mean notes he sent,
- Remember: Free speech is a right, not an obligation. Two ears, one mouth,
- You can listen more than you talk. You can speak only when you’re certain it’s not better left unsaid.
- In life, in war, in business, we often only get one moment, one opportunity. Nobody is going to give you a do-over. You never get to go back and try it differently—to make up for deficiencies in preparation, to time things better, to get more leverage.
- Just as we do with our relationship to drugs or devices, we have to ask ourselves: Who is in charge? Our mind? Or our slavish need to be the biggest, the winningest, the richest, the most powerful, the most famous? The need to do more, to get more, to achieve again and again? We have to ask: What is this really bringing me? What am I actually getting out of it? Did Napoleon’s accomplishments make him happy? Power and wealth didn’t even make him secure! Besides the guilt and shame, which he clearly deserved, he died alone on his second island in the middle of the ocean!
- So many “rich” people find themselves in this position. The point of success was supposed to be security and freedom and contentment. In reality, it brought them anxiety, envy, and instability.
- Money doesn’t buy happiness … but it can buy you out of some frustrations. Nor can it give you freedom, if you are dependent on it to provide you with things you don’t need … or more than any reasonable person actually needs. The problem is that many of us tell ourselves that someday we’ll be beyond this, that if we can just earn enough, be successful enough, we won’t have to consider any of it. We will be beyond moderation and financial conscientiousness. We will have transcended the everyday worries of the common man. We can just do what we want, when we want, as much as we want. Because we’ll be “good,” we’ll have “arrived.” Here’s the thing: This never happens. “Fuck-you money” is a chimera. You never get it. Nobody does. Poor people have poor-people problems and rich people have rich-people problems because people always have problems. You’re always going to be subject to the necessity of self-discipline. Or at least, you’ll never be immune from the consequence of ignoring it. And is “fuck-you money” really such an admirable goal anyway? To have so much money you don’t have to care about anyone or anything? That’s not virtue, it’s childishness. All you really need is enough money to be comfortable enough to politely say, “No, thanks. I’d rather not.” To never have to do anything for a buck that’s contrary to your values. To be able to stick with your main thing. No amount of money is ever going to truly free you. But being less dependent, caring less about money? That will free you right now.
- Plenty of people have made plenty … it doesn’t have to make them worse. Lou Gehrig and Babe Ruth were both in the .001 percent. Queen Elizabeth and King George IV inherited the same priceless jewels and fortune. We decide which direction we’ll go. Better or worse? A luxury or a burden? We decide whether we’ll deserve what we’ve gotten.
- The Japanese word for this is kaizen. Continual improvement. Always finding something to work on, to make a little progress on. Never being satisfied, always looking to grow. Revolution? Transformation? That’s what amateurs chase. The pros are after evolution.
- Think about it: Most people don’t even show up. Of the people who do, most don’t really push themselves. So to show up and be disciplined about daily improvement? You are the rarest of the rare.
- To err is human … but to err less each day is to become closer to the divine.
- Anyone, whether they’re a professional athlete or a house-cleaner, can get better at their job. You can get better at being a person, a citizen, a son or a daughter. You can get better at how you think, how you focus, what you think about.
- How much progress could you make if you made just a little each day over the course of an entire life? What might this journey look like, where might it lead, if each bit of progress you made presented both the opportunity and the obligation to make a little more progress, and you seized those opportunities, you lived up to those obligations, each and every time? Will you choose to take this journey? Will you continue on even when you’ve reached further than you ever thought you could go? Or will you stop there? Are you going to keep practicing? Or have you decided that this is good enough? That you’re good enough? Will you remain as you are? Or become what you’re capable of? Because once you stop getting better, there’s only one direction to go … “Do the best you can,” the emperor says in Marguerite Yourcenar’s beautiful novel Memoirs of Hadrian.
- The pursuit of discipline means being disciplined in all things, especially little things. And time—how we spend it, its tiny increments—is something small that actually amounts to something very large.
- Some people claim that time is just a construct. If that is true, it is perhaps humanity’s greatest creation. Because time is the way we measure the only truly nonrenewable resource we have. No one is making more of it. Once lost, it cannot be recovered. It is also an incredibly powerful force, as anyone who has ever watched small amounts of interest applied over a long enough period can attest. You see, time that is wasted is also wasting us. When we kill time, we are killing ourselves. We have to learn how to use time or else it will use us … up. That is why we do our work promptly. Why we get to the point.
- You missed opportunities to get better. You missed opportunities to make progress. You didn’t let patience work to your advantage. You disrespected other people (who you made wait). You disrespected your cause (which you deprived of your presence).
- Heavy is the head that wears the crown … and gray goes the hair underneath it.
- We have to show, not tell: first in line for danger, last in line for rewards. First in line for duty, last in line for recognition. To lead, you have to bleed. Figuratively speaking. But sometimes also literally.
- the entire point of self-discipline is that we are strict. We hold ourselves to high standards. We don’t accept excuses. We push ourselves always to be better.
- You don’t win everything, every time—not in war, in life, or in business. A person who doesn’t know how to disengage, to cut their losses, or to extricate themselves is a vulnerable person.
- Hope is important but it is not a strategy. Denial is not the same thing as determination. Delusion is destruction. Greed will get you in the end.
- Queen Elizabeth inherited the monarchy. Marcus Aurelius was selected for the purple as a boy. But it wasn’t the throne that made either of them kingly, it was their behavior. They were what the ancients called first citizens, for their character as much as their rank. As Marcus said, his aim was never to be the most powerful king, never to conquer the most territory, or build the most beautiful buildings. Instead, he was after “perfection of character: to live your last day, every day, without frenzy or sloth or pretense.” It just happens that wonderful external accomplishments, like those achieved by Elizabeth and Marcus, can come out of internal endeavor. They are not the goal, they are the byproduct.
- Self-discipline has never been about punishment or deprivation. It is about becoming the best, the best that you are capable of becoming.
- Words don’t matter. Deeds do.
