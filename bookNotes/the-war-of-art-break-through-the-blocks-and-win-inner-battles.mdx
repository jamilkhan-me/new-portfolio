## Summary

## Key concepts

## Important quotes

- Genius is a Latin word; the Romans used it to denote an inner spirit, holy and inviolable, which watches over us, guiding us to our calling. A writer writes with his genius; an artist paints with hers; everyone who creates operates from this sacramental center. It is our soul's seat, the vessel that holds our being-in-potential, our star's beacon and Polaris.

###

- You know, Hitler wanted to be an artist. At eighteen he took his inheritance, seven hundred kronen, and moved to Vienna to live and study. He applied to the Academy of Fine Arts and later to the School of Architecture. Ever see one of his paintings? Neither have I. Resistance beat him. Call it overstatement but I'll say it anyway: it was easier for Hitler to start World War II than it was for him to face a blank square of canvas.

###

- Resistance cannot be seen, touched, heard, or smelled. But it can be felt. We experience it as an energy field radiating from a work-in-potential. It's a repelling force. It's negative. Its aim is to shove us away, distract us, prevent us from doing our work.

###

- Resistance will tell you anything to keep you from doing your work. It will perjure, fabricate, falsify; seduce, bully, cajole. Resistance is protean. It will assume any form, if that's what it takes to deceive you. It will reason with you like a lawyer or jam a nine-millimeter in your face like a stickup man. R e s i s t a n c e has no c o n s c i e n c e . It will p l e d g e anything to get a deal, then double-cross you as soon as your back is turned. If you take Resistance at its word, you deserve everything you get. Resistance is always lying and always full of shit.

###

- I t i s a n e n g i n e o f destruction, programmed from the factory with one object only: to prevent us from doing our work. Resistance is implacable, intractable, indefatigable. Reduce it to a single cell and that cell will continue to attack.

###

- The athlete knows the day will never come when he wakes up pain-free. He has to play hurt.

###

- the m o r e t r o u b l e s w e ' v e g o t , the better and richer that part becomes.

###

- the Principle of Priority, which states (a) you must know the difference between what is urgent and what is important, and (b) you must do what's important first.

###

- T h e professional, on the other hand, understands delayed gratification. He is the ant, not the grasshopper; the tortoise, not the hare.

###

- T h e professional arms himself with patience, not only to give the stars time to align in his career, but to keep himself from flaming out in each individual work. He knows that any job, whether it's a novel or a kitchen remodel, takes twice as long as he thinks and costs twice as much. He accepts that.

###

- T h e professional gives an ear to criticism, seeking to l e a r n and g r o w . But she never f o r g e t s that R e s i s t a n c e is u s i n g criticism against her on a far more diabolical level. Resistance enlists criticism to reinforce the fifth column of fear already at work inside the artist's head, seeking to break her will and crack her dedication. T h e professional does not fall for this. Her resolution, before all others, remains: No matter what, I will never let R e s i s t a n c e beat m

###

- T h e p r o f e s s i o n a l cannot let h i m s e l f take humiliation personally. Humiliation, like rejection and criticism, is the external reflection of internal Resistance.

###

- Have you ever worked in an office? Then you know about Monday morning status meetings. T h e group assembles in the conference room and the boss goes over what assignments each team member is responsible for in the coming week. When the meeting breaks up, an assistant prepares a work sheet and distributes it. When this hits your desk an hour later, you know exactly what you have to do that week. I have one of those meetings with myself every Monday. I sit down and go over my assignments. Then I type it up and distribute it to myself. I have corporate stationery and corporate business cards and a corporate checkbook. I write off corporate expenses and pay corporate taxes. I have different credit cards for myself and my corporation. If we think of ourselves as a corporation, it gives us a healthy distance on ourselves. We're less subjective. We don't take blows as personally. We're more cold-blooded; we can price our wares more realistically. Sometimes, as J o e Blow himself, I'm too mild-mannered to go out and sell. But as J o e Blow, Inc., I can pimp the hell out of myself. I'm not me anymore. I'm Me, Inc.

###

- There's no mystery to turning pro. It's a decision brought about by an act of will. We make up our mind to view o u r s e l v e s as p r o s and we do it. S i m p l e as that.
