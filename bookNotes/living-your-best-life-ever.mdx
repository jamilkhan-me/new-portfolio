## Summary

## Important quotes

- Whenever i am asked the no. 1 skill that has been responsible for my success, i am quick to answer: my ability to set, stick to and achieve big goals.
- There is a very specific process for not only discerning what you really want and what is most important to you, but also the development of a specific plan of action that will keep you motivated and accountable long enough to see those goals and dreams come to fruition.
- Learning to set goals is the master skill of success. Without goals your life is like a boat without a rudder. You drift along with the current, inevitably crashing onto the rocks time and time again. Proper goal-setting puts you in a speedboat and gives you a target to steer toward. You will go directly to your destination and arrive with great speed.
- Why is it that the first time I asked you to cross that sky-high plank, you said no way, yet, the second time you wouldn’t hesitate? The risks and the dangers are the same. What changed? Your “why” changed—your reason for wanting to do it. You see, when the reason is big enough, you will be willing to perform almost anything. Here’s a story to
- they saw the baby’s mother walking toward them. They realized that she was coming down the mountain that they hadn’t figured out how to climb. They saw that she had the baby strapped to her back. How could that be? one man greeted her and said, “We couldn’t climb this mountain. How did you do this when we, the strongest and most able men in the village, couldn’t do it?” She looked intently at them and said, “it wasn’t your baby.”
- The power of your why is what motivates you through the grueling, mundane and laborious tasks. All of the hows in life will be meaningless until your whys are powerful enough. until you’ve set your desire and motivation in place, you’ll abandon any new path you seek to better your life.
- History often repeats itself. Why you quit your first diet is likely why you’ll quit your next one. The communication problems from your first marriage will likely surface in your second. The new Year’s resolution you failed to complete last year will likely be your resolution this year.
- We all arrive the same—naked, vulnerable and ignorant. What becomes of our lives from that point forward is what we create for ourselves.
- Whatever we’re thinking about becomes our expectation of what will happen. good or bad, our thoughts have a powerful effect on our lives. This is why many of the great self-improvement books have focused on the power of thoughts: Think and Grow Rich, The Power of Positive Thinking, As a Man Thinketh, The Magic of Thinking Big, etc.
- research has proven that practicing gratitude improves our emotional and physical well-being, reduces stress, worry, fear, anxiety and the conditions closely associated with these emotions such as high blood pressure, depression, heart disease, and immune system deficiencies. gratitude can save and prolong your life.
- “if you haven’t found something you are willing to die for, you aren’t fit to live.”
- Adjust your goals so that they are time sensitive. specific, measurable, attainable, relevant and time sensitive— are your goals smart?
- it’s important to understand that you don’t get in life what you want; you get in life what you are. You will only achieve the level of success in your life that equals your level of self-worth. But the human tendency is to engage in the study of effects, while giving little attention to the cause. i see this travesty played out every day. People complain about their terrible marriage, and so they leave it. oddly enough, they end up with similar problems in the next relationship.
- This is why many mega-jackpot lottery winners lose it all and end up where they were financially before they came into the windfall.
- This is why many mega-jackpot lottery winners lose it all and end up where they were financially before they came into the windfall. Their monetary wealth was far above their self-worth set point, So, the key is to raise your set point, or self-worth, self-esteem, mindset, attitude, philosophy and character. When those get raised, everything in your life will be raised with them.
- This is also why people who make a goal of losing weight begin a diet, lose the weight they want but end up fluctuating back to the same weight or more than when they started. Why? Because they temporarily lost the weight, but didn’t change their set point. So their internal thermostat kicks in and they end up exactly where they started, or worse.
- “if you want to have more… you have to BECoME more. Success is not a doing process; it is a becoming process. What you do, what you pursue, will elude you—it can be like chasing butterflies. Success is something you attract by the person you become.”
- “For things to improve, you have to improve. For things to get better, you have to get better. For things to change, you have to change. When you change, everything changes for you.”
- the journey of continuous personal development. if you want more in life, this is the yellow brick road to getting there.
- “Success is not something you pursue. What you pursue eludes you. Success is something you attract by the person you become. if you want to have more, you must become more.”
- Do i have all the attributes i expect in this smart and successful woman? Yowza! That was a totally different way of looking at this.
- So i looked back at my list and asked myself two important questions first: Do i have all the attributes i expect in this smart and successful woman? Yowza! That was a totally different way of looking at this. My second question was: What kind of man would this incredible woman be looking for? Who do I need to become to be attractive to a woman of this substance? uh-oh, i thought. Yet, there was the key.
- “to achieve something you have never achieved before you must become someone you have never been.”
- The difference between a dream and a goal is implementation—writing it down and creating a specific plan to achieve your goal.
- “The world is full of dreamers, there aren’t enough who will move ahead and begin to take concrete steps to actualize their vision.”
- Committed, disciplined and sustained action is the final ingredient in the miracle process of materializing any achievement you can conceive.
- “Don’t wait. The time will never be just right. NOW is the best time to act.”
- As virgil said, “Fortune favors the bold.” re-instill your faith in yourself. its absence is the only thing keeping you from your greatness. Start living with audacity. Have chutzpa. Stand away from the crowd. Don’t follow the herd any longer. never again settle for common, mediocre or average results in life. Have a higher standard for yourself than anyone around you would expect. Be different, think different and act different. Be what others are afraid to be.
- if you have gone as far as you can, you can still go a little bit farther. it’s on the extra mile where success is obtained—extra effort, extra hours, extra preparation, extra care and extra calls. Extra is what separates you from average. it is the “extra” that goes in front of “ordinary” to make you extraordinary.
- As Calvin Coolidge said, “Press on. nothing in the world can take the place of persistence. Talent will not; nothing is more common than unsuccessful men with talent. genius will not; unrewarded genius is almost a proverb. Education alone will not; the world is full of educated derelicts. Persistence and determination alone are omnipotent.”
- “Our greatest glory is not in never falling, but in rising every time we fall.”
- Most people give up just when they’re about to achieve success. They give up the last minute of the game, one foot away from the winning touchdown.
- starts—they sign up for the gym memberships, they buy the diet books, they go to seminars, they start their new prospecting plan, their new date night plan, their new meditation plan, their new study plan—but very few continue. very few will see it through. When it comes down to it, your new plans, your new actions, your new behaviors, have to be implemented into your monthly, weekly and ultimately daily routine. A routine is something you do every day without fail and eventually without thinking about.
- And our society doesn’t lack the will to start. Everyone starts—they sign up for the gym memberships, they buy the diet books, they go to seminars, they start their new prospecting plan, their new date night plan, their new meditation plan, their new study plan—but very few continue. very few will see it through. When it comes down to it, your new plans, your new actions, your new behaviors, have to be implemented into your monthly, weekly and ultimately daily routine. A routine is something you do every day without fail and eventually without thinking about it.
- Consider this: if you’ve become successful at doing anything, you probably developed a routine for it. How do you remember to keep your teeth healthy, your pantry full, your children dressed, fed and on time for school every day? You have incorporated the daily behaviors into a routine. We also develop routines to keep ourselves sane. if we had to consciously think about every step of each ordinary task—making breakfast, driving the kids to school, getting to work, and so on—our lives would grind to a halt. Aristotle said, “We are what we repeatedly do.” John C. Maxwell said in an interview, “You will never change your life until you change something you do daily. The secret of your success is found in your daily routine.”
- on the journey toward your goals, you, too, will be off track more than 80 percent of the time. The key is to have your own internal “gyroscope” to put you back on track. You, too, will hit unexpected external conditions and need a system to recalibrate your path and guide you directly toward your goal.
- Having consulted for hundreds of companies and entrepreneurs, i can tell you no business ever grew according to its beautifully crafted business plan. Some grew faster, some slower and some became something completely unexpected and exceedingly greater than could have ever been imagined initially. So why, then, make a plan at all? That question is best answered by Dwight D. Eisenhower: “in preparing for battle i have always found that plans are useless, but planning is indispensable.”
- Do what most people don’t: Stay consistent.
- Lack of consistency is the subtle stealer of dreams. The stop and start process kills progress in any pursuit. in fact, inconsistency is one of the biggest reasons people don’t achieve their goals, and instead end up living a life of frustration and disappointment.
- Zig Ziglar uses the analogy of a hand-pumped water well. The water table is 25 feet below the ground. A pipe runs down to the water table, and you have to pump the lever to create the suction that brings the water above the ground and out of the spout.
- Eight weeks of working out at the gym, and they don’t look like a victoria’s Secret or Calvin Klein underwear model. They didn’t make $10,000 their first 90 days in their new business. Again, they don’t see the results they were expecting. They think their plan isn’t working, and they quit. But the wise person persists. if you continue to pump, eventually, you will get a full and steady stream of water. Congratulations, success!
- it’s not how you or your competition start; it’s how you continue. if you stay consistent, even slowly (the tortoise), ultimately, you will beat the most talented of competitors (the hare). ConSiSTEnCY is why the tortoise beats the hare every time. i can hear you asking, “okay, i get that my ability to stay consistent long after my initial mood of commitment has left me will be the key to my success, so then how do i keep myself consistent?”
- You are one to three key behaviors away from a massive transformation in any area of your life. Think about it: improving your marriage could need just a few consistent behavior changes to transform your current connection and intimacy. Your sales results? A few consistent behaviors could massively transform your results. This is true in your health, parenting, networking, leadership… any area of your life.
- track your behavior. This is where the accountability and consistency come in. The problem is most people are not conscious of their behavior. Scientific researchers will tell you more than 95 percent of all our behavior is performed without conscious thought. You can say that we sleepwalk through most of our life. The only way to change these unconscious patterns is to be constantly conscious of the new behaviors and actions we need to
- The review process is like the gyroscope checking to see where you are by comparison of where you should be. You made a plan for what you were going to do. You did it. now you have to look back and see how you did.
- you have to regularly review to see how you are doing so you can see any bad patterns and make immediate course corrections.
- Scientific research has now concluded that there is no such thing as a “born genius” predesigned for greatness. And there is no such thing as innate talent either. i know that sounds outrageous; certainly you are thinking of people like Einstein, Mozart, Da vinci, Tiger Woods, Lance Armstrong, Bill gates, The Beatles, Elvis or others. But a study of each of those cases (in books like The Genius in All of Us by David Shenk) reveals a truth different than any inborn advantage. in all cases, each of them, and many others society has deemed “gifted,” developed what became known as their talents through consistent, rigorous, unrelenting and repeated improvement. They developed a nearly maniacal, obsessive drive to continually improve themselves, improve their skill, their performance and their outcomes. Malcolm gladwell also wrote about this in his book Outliers and explained that mastery is something DEvELoPED through about 10,000 hours of deliberate, concentrated and focused practice. The onLY thing that separates average achievers from superachievers is dedication to improvement. The fantastic news in all of this is: greatness doesn’t come from DnA; there is no such thing as innate “talent” or “genius,” which means we can ALL become a “genius” and reach mastery in any area of our life, if we commit to a process of deliberate and purposeful improvement.
- if you would like to access your potential greatness and achieve master-level performance, then know that the idea of deliberate practice and deliberate improvement is serious work and requires a serious commitment and consistency. As explained further in The Genius in All of Us, playing lots of chess or soccer or golf—or in your case, making a lot of sales calls, doing a lot of public speaking, performing a lot of trainings, negotiating a lot of contracts—is not enough. A desire for improvement is not enough. Simply taking lessons from a wonderful teacher is not enough. Deliberate improvement requires a mindset of never, ever, being satisfied with your current ability. it requires a constant self-critique, a capacity for daily disappointment and failure and a never-ending resolve to dust oneself off and to try again and again and again. it also requires enormous, life altering amounts of time—a daily grinding commitment to becoming better.
- Excellence requires us to live with nobility, honor and integrity. it requires us to keep our promises and commitments, and to do what’s right even when no one looking or even when someone has wronged you.
- That is what i want to encourage you to do; use the Plan, Do, review and improve process to continually check on your progress and make the adjustments necessary, and push yourself through the ongoing gritty process of continually getting better and better… until one day you are nearly unrecognizable to your friends and family. Certainly your lifestyle, your relationships, your body, vitality and bank account will be fantastically unrecognizable by comparison to where you are starting today!
