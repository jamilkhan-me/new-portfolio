## Key concepts

- success comes from doing, not declaring. this is a continuous process. You have to keep earning it always.
- whatever you choose, brace yourself, because people are always going to tell you that you’re wrong. You have to know your preferences well because no matter what you do, someone will tell you you’re wrong. If you’re not into money, many people will say you’re foolish. If you’re not into charity, many people will say you’re greedy. If you’re not into crowds, many people will say you’re missing out.
- Before you start something, think of the ways it could end.
- Your happiness depends on where you’re focusing.

## Important quotes

1. No matter what you say, your actions reveal the truth. Your actions show you what you actually want.
2. There are two smart reactions to this: 1. Stop lying to yourself, and admit your real priorities. 2. Start doing what you say you want to do, and see if it’s really true.
3. One way to get famous is to let others make more money, while you take the spotlight. I learned this while living in Los Angeles, when I got to know some famous Hollywood actors and realized they’re not as rich as you’d think. The richest people in Hollywood are the ones you’ve never heard of, because they’ve optimized their careers for money. They know that others are willing to take less money in return for more fame, so they proft from them.
4. We shouldn’t preserve our first opinions as if they reflect our pure, untarnished, true nature. They’re often just the result of inexperience or a temporary phase. Old opinions shouldn’t define who we are in the future.
5. The disciplined ones had succeeded. The temperamental ones had famed out. The ones who’d acted like leaders were now leaders. The ones who’d blamed everyone else for their lack of results were still doing just that. It didn’t matter where they were before. What mattered was the direction they were headed. Some people had been unpaid interns at the bottom of the ranks, but their determination and smart approaches had led them to the top. Some had been famous or successful but seemed so fragile or combustible, and yep — they’d come tumbling down. Character isn’t fate or destiny. Character isn’t DNA, decided before birth. Character is the result of your little choices and little actions. How you do anything is how you do everything. It all matters. Your actions are completely under your control, and seem to be the best indicator of future success.
6. Fish don’t know they’re in water. If you tried to explain it, they’d say, “Water? What’s water?” They’re so surrounded by it that it’s impossible to see. They can’t see it until they jump outside of it. This is how I feel about culture. We’re so surrounded by it that it’s impossible to see. Many things we think are true are really just our local culture. We can’t see it until we get outside of it
7. Everyone knows about being introverted versus extroverted, but there’s another axis that makes a much bigger difference. It’s present-focused versus future-focused.
8. Present-focused people:
   - • Pursue pleasure, excitement, and novelty
   - Focus on immediate gratifcation
   - Especially appreciate life, nature, and the people around them
   - Are playful, impulsive, and sensual • Avoid anything boring, diffcult, or repetitive
   - Get fully immersed in the moment and lose track of time
   - Are more likely to use drugs and alcohol
   - Are better at helping others than helping themselves

- Future-focused people:

- Delay gratification •
- Are driven with self-discipline because they vividly see their future goals
- Tend to live in their minds, picturing other selves, scenarios, and possible futures
- Especially love their work
- Exercise, invest, and go for preventative health exams
- Are better at helping themselves, but worse at helping others
- Are more likely to be successful in their careers, but often at the expense of personal relationships, which require a present focus

2. Your time-focus is environmental. People who grow up in unstable places are more present-focused because imagining the future is hard. People who grow up in cold climates are more future-focused because they have to prepare for the winter. Both mindsets are necessary. You need a present-focus to enjoy life. But too much present-focus can prevent the deeper happiness of achievement. (I call this “shallow happy” versus “deep happy”.
3. People say that your first reaction is the most honest, but I disagree. Your first reaction is usually outdated. Either it’s an answer you came up with long ago and now use instead of thinking, or it’s a knee-jerk emotional response to something in your past.
4. Imagine what it’s like to be the silver medalist. If you’d been just one second faster, you could have won the gold! Damn! So close! Damn damn damn! Full of envy, you’d keep comparing yourself to the gold winner. Now imagine what it’s like to be the bronze medalist. If you’d been just one second slower, you wouldn’t have won anything! Awesome! You’d be thrilled that you’re officially an Olympic medalist and get to stand on the winner’s podium.
5. Instead of comparing up to the next higher situation, compare down to the next-lower one.
6. Procrastination hack: change “and” to “or” My unwritten condition for when to exercise was this: When it’s a nice day, and I’ve finished my work, and I haven’t just eaten, and I’m feeling energetic. But of course that rarely happens, so I wasn’t exercising enough. My coach suggested I change “and” to “or”. When it’s a nice day, or I’ve finished my work, or I haven’t just eaten, or I’m feeling energetic. Now I exercise quite often. Do you have a list of conditions you need to have met before you do something? Try changing “and” to “or.
7. Great insight comes only from opening your mind to many options.
8. Imagine you’ve got a big question like, “Should I quit my job and start my own company?” You go ask the advice of some successful people you respect. Because they can’t know everything about you and your unique situation, they’ll give advice that’s really just a refection of their own current situation
9. Early in your career, the best strategy is to say yes to everything. The more things you try, and the more people you meet, the better. Each one might lead to your lucky break.
10. You may have heard this story: Buridan’s donkey is standing halfway between a pile of hay and a bucket of water. It keeps looking left and right, trying to decide between hay and water. Unable to decide, it eventually dies of hunger and thirst. A donkey can’t think of the future. If he could, he’d clearly realize that he could frst drink the water, then go eat the hay. Don’t be a donkey. You can do everything you want to do. You just need foresight and patience. If you’re thirty now and have six different directions you want to pursue, then you can do each one for ten years, and have done all of them by the time you’re ninety. It seems ridiculous to plan to age ninety when you’re thirty, right? But it’s probably coming, so you might as well take advantage of it.
11. Most people overestimate what they can do in one year, and underestimate what they can do in ten years.
12. Most people overestimate what they can do in one year, and underestimate what they can do in ten years. Think long term. Use the future. Don’t be short sighted. Don’t be a donkey
13. To assume you’re below average is to admit you’re still learning. You focus on what you need to improve, not your past accomplishments
14. We’re clearly bad judges of our own creations. We should just put them out there and let the world decide.
15. Your main obstacle to this amazing life will be self-control. You’ll need good time management to stop addictions like social media and video-watching, and make your art your main relaxing activity
16. Most full-time artists I know only spend an hour or two a day actually doing their art. The rest is spent on the boring work that comes with trying to make it a full-time career. So skip the art career and just do the art
17. Don’t try to make your job your whole life. Don’t try to make your art your sole income. Let each be what it is, and put in the extra effort to balance the two, for a great life.
18. Don’t try to make your job your whole life. Don’t try to make your art your sole income. Let each be what it is, and put in the extra effort to balance the two, for a great life
19. As time goes on, we get smarter. We learn more about ourselves or our customers — what we or they really want. Therefore, we’re at our dumbest at the beginning, and at our smartest at the end. So when should you make decisions? When you have the most information, when you’re at your smartest: as late as possible
20. Don’t announce anything. Don’t choose a name. Don’t make a website or an app. Don’t build a system. You need to be free to completely change or ditch your idea. Then you get your frst paying customer. Provide a oneon-one personal service. Then you get another paying customer. Prove a real demand. Then, as late as possible, you offcially start your business.
21. My friend was a brilliant conversationalist, one of the brightest minds I’ve met, but he never put his thoughts into writing. It’s extra-sad that his thoughts are gone, too. So this lesson is dedicated to you, Milt Olin. I’m going to start writing again. sivers.org/milt 95

28. Being smart means thinking things through. It means trying to fnd the real answer, not the easiest answer. Being stupid means avoiding thinking by jumping to conclusions. Jumping to a conclusion is like quitting a game. You lose by default.
29. So when someone says, “They’re so stupid!” it means they’ve stopped thinking. They say it because it’s satisfying to jump to that conclusion.
