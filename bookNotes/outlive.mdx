## Summary

In Medicine 3.0, we have five tactical domains that we can address in order to alter someone’s health. The first is exercise, which I consider to be by far the most potent domain in terms of its impact on both lifespan and healthspan. Of course, exercise is not just one thing, so I break it down into its components of aerobic efficiency, maximum aerobic output (VO2 max), strength, and stability, all of which we’ll discuss in more detail. Next is diet or nutrition—or as I prefer to call it, nutritional biochemistry. The third domain is sleep, which has gone underappreciated by Medicine 2.0 until relatively recently. The fourth domain encompasses a set of tools and techniques to manage and improve emotional health. Our fifth and final domain consists of the various drugs, supplements, and hormones that doctors learn about in medical school and beyond. I lump these into one bucket called exogenous molecules, meaning molecules we ingest that come from outside the body.

## Key concepts

- If we want to reduce deaths from cardiovascular disease, we need to begin thinking about prevention in people in their forties and even thirties.
- How much food we eat correlates somehow with how long we live. This idea goes all the way back to Hippocrates, but more modern experiments have demonstrated, over and over, that reducing the food intake of lab animals could lengthen their lives. The first person to really put the idea of eating less into practice, in a rigorous, documented way, was not an ancient Greek or a modern scientist but a sixteenth-century Italian businessman named Alvise Cornaro. A selfmade real estate developer who had become tremendously wealthy.
- There are reams of data supporting the notion that even a fairly minimal amount of exercise can lengthen your life by several years. It delays the onset of chronic diseases, pretty much across the board, but it is also amazingly effective at extending and improving healthspan. Not only does it reverse physical decline, which I suppose is somewhat obvious, but it can slow or reverse cognitive decline as well. (It also has benefits in terms of emotional health, although those are harder to quantify.) So if you adopt only one new set of habits based on reading this book, it must be in the realm of exercise. If you currently exercise, you will likely want to rethink and modify your program. And if exercise is not a part of your life at the moment, you are not alone—77 percent of the US population is like you. Now is the time to change that. Right now. Even a little bit of daily activity is much better than nothing. Going from zero weekly exercise to just ninety minutes per week can reduce your risk of dying from all causes by 14 percent. It’s very hard to find a drug that can do that. Thus, my answer to questions like the one my friend John Griffin asked me is yes and yes. Yes, you should be doing more cardio. And yes, you should be lifting more weights.
- In case my point here isn’t clear enough, let me restate it: don’t ignore protein. It’s the one macronutrient that is absolutely essential to our goals. There’s no minimum requirement for carbohydrates or fats (in practical terms), but if you shortchange protein, you will most certainly pay a price, particularly as you age.
- If there is one type of food that I would eliminate from everyone’s diet if I could, it would be fructose-sweetened drinks, including both sodas and fruit juices, which deliver too much fructose, too quickly, to a gut and liver that much prefer to process fructose slowly. Just eat fruit and let nature provide the right amount of fiber and water.

## Important quotes

- Many pundits have been predicting a glorious new era of “personalized” or “precision” medicine, where our care will be tailored to our exact needs, down to our very genes.

- Medicine 3.0, in my opinion, is not really about technology; rather, it requires an evolution in our mindset, a shift in the way in which we approach medicine. I’ve broken it down into four main points. First, Medicine 3.0 places a far greater emphasis on prevention than treatment. When did Noah build the ark? Long before it began to rain. Medicine 2.0 tries to figure out how to get dry after it starts raining. Medicine 3.0 studies meteorology and tries to determine whether we need to build a better roof, or a boat. Second, Medicine 3.0 considers the patient as a unique individual. Medicine 2.0 treats everyone as basically the same, obeying the findings of the clinical trials that underlie evidence-based medicine. These trials take heterogeneous inputs (the people in the study or studies) and come up with homogeneous results (the average result across all those people). Evidence based medicine then insists that we apply those average findings back to individuals. The problem is that no patient is strictly average. Medicine 3.0 takes the findings of evidence-based medicine and goes one step further, looking more deeply into the data to determine how our patient is similar or different from the “average” subject in the study, and how its findings might or might not be applicable to them. Think of it as “evidence-informed” medicine.

- The real value of caloric restriction research lies in the insights it has contributed to our understanding of the aging process itself. CR studies have helped to uncover critical cellular mechanisms related to nutrients and longevity. Reducing the amount of nutrients available to a cell seems to trigger a group of innate pathways that enhance the cell’s stress resistance and metabolic efficiency—all of them related, in some way, to mTOR. The first of these is an enzyme called AMP-activated protein kinase, or AMPK for short. AMPK is like the low-fuel light on the dashboard of your car: when it senses low levels of nutrients (fuel), it activates, triggering a cascade of actions. While this typically happens as a response to lack of nutrients, AMPK is also activated when we exercise, responding to the transient drop in nutrient levels. Just as you would change your itinerary if your fuel light came on, heading for the nearest gas station rather than Grandma’s house, AMPK prompts the cell to conserve and seek alternative sources of energy.

- Liver may be the most regenerative organ in the human body. When a healthy person donates a portion of their liver, both donor and recipient end up with an almost full-sized, fully functional liver within about eight weeks of the surgery, and the majority of that growth takes place in just the first two weeks.

- Metabolism is the process by which we take in nutrients and break them down for use in the body. In someone who is metabolically healthy, those nutrients are processed and sent to their proper destinations. But when someone is metabolically unhealthy, many of the calories they consume end up where they are not needed, at best—or outright harmful, at worst.

- The twist here is that fat—that is, subcutaneous fat, the layer of fat just beneath our skin—is actually the safest place to store excess energy. Fat in and of itself is not bad. It’s where we should put surplus calories. That’s how we evolved. While fat might not be culturally or aesthetically desirable in our modern world, subcutaneous fat actually plays an important role in maintaining metabolic health. The Yale University endocrinologist Gerald Shulman, one of the leading researchers in diabetes, once published an elegant experiment demonstrating the necessity of fat: when he surgically implanted fat tissue into insulin-resistant mice, thereby making them more fat, he found that their metabolic dysfunction was cured almost instantly. Their new fat cells sucked up their excess blood glucose and stored it safely.

- Type 2 diabetes is known as a “disease of civilization,” meaning it has only come to prominence in the modern era. Among primitive tribes and in prior times, it was largely unknown. Its symptoms had been recognized for thousands of years, going back to ancient Egypt (as well as ancient India), but it was the Greek physician Aretaeus of Cappadocia who named it diabetes, describing it as “a melting down of the flesh and limbs into urine.”

- The good news is that we have tremendous agency over this. Changing how we exercise, what we eat, and how we sleep (see Part III) can completely turn the tables in our favor. The bad news is that these things require effort to escape the default modern environment that has conspired against our ancient (and formerly helpful) fat-storing genes, by overfeeding, undermoving, and undersleeping us all.

- It is not an accident that the two biggest risk factors for heart disease, smoking and high blood pressure, cause damage to the endothelium. Smoking damages it chemically, while high blood pressure does so mechanically.

- I was still in my thirties, yet I likely already had all three of the major prerequisites for heart disease: significant lipoprotein burden or apoB, LDL oxidation or modification (leading to the plaques that my calcium scan revealed), and a high level of background inflammation. None of these is enough to guarantee that someone will develop heart disease, but all three are necessary to develop it.

- Elevated Lp(a) is the first thing I look for. It is the most prevalent hereditary risk factor for heart disease, and its danger is amplified by the fact that it is still largely flying under the radar of Medicine 2.0, although that is beginning to change.

- Together, our stories illustrate three blind spots of Medicine 2.0 when it comes to dealing with atherosclerotic disease: first, an overly simplistic view of lipids that fails to understand the importance of total lipoprotein burden (apoB) and how much one needs to reduce it in order to truly reduce risk; second, a general lack of knowledge about other bad actors such as Lp(a); and third, a failure to fully grasp the lengthy time course of atherosclerotic disease, and the implications this carries if we seek true prevention.

- When I look at a patient’s blood panel for the first time, my eyes immediately dart to two numbers: apoB and Lp(a). I look at the other numbers, too, but these two tell me the most when it comes to predicting their risk of ASCVD. ApoB not only tells me the concentration of LDL particles (which, you’ll recall, is more predictive of disease than the concentration of cholesterol found within LDL particles, LDL-C), but it also captures the concentration of VLDL particles, which as members of the apoB family can also contribute to atherosclerosis. Furthermore, even someone whose apoB is low can still have a dangerously elevated Lp(a).

- This is my starting point with any patient, whether they are like Anahad (with one prominent risk factor) or like me (lots of smaller risk factors). Our first order of business is to reduce the burden of apoB particles, primarily LDLs but also VLDLs, which can be dangerous in their own right. And do so dramatically, not marginally or incrementally. We want it as low as possible, sooner rather than later. We must also pay attention to other markers of risk, notably those associated with metabolic health, such as insulin, visceral fat, and homocysteine, an amino acid that in high concentrations is strongly associated with increased risk of heart attack, stroke, and dementia.

- Mortality rates from cardiovascular disease and cerebrovascular disease have dropped by two-thirds since the middle of the twentieth century. But cancer still kills Americans at almost exactly the same rate as it did fifty years ago.

- Surgery is of limited value when cancer has metastasized, or spread. Metastatic cancers can be slowed by chemotherapy, but they virtually always come back, often more resistant to treatment than ever. Our benchmark for success in a patient, or remission, is typically five-year survival, nothing more. We don’t dare utter the word cure.

- Breast cancer genetically distinct from colon cancer (as the researchers expected), but no two breast cancer tumors are very much alike. If two women have breast cancer, at the same stage, their tumor genomes are likely to be very different from each other. Therefore, it would be difficult if not impossible to devise one treatment for both women based on the genetic profile of their tumors. Rather than revealing the shape of the forest, then, The Cancer Genome Atlas merely dragged us deeper into the maze of the trees.

- Nearly forty years into the War on Cancer, however, Watson himself had become convinced that genetics did not hold the key to successful cancer treatment after all. “We may have to turn our main research focus away from decoding the genetic instructions behind cancer and toward understanding the chemical reactions within cancer cells,” he wrote. It was time, he argued, to start looking at therapies that targeted cancer’s metabolism as well as its genetics.

- We set up another appointment for a week later to review her initial blood work. I rely as much as one can on biomarkers, so we run a comprehensive array of tests, but there are a few things that I immediately scan for when I get a new patient’s results back. Among them is their level of Lp(a), the highrisk lipoprotein that we talked about in chapter 7, along with their apoB concentration. A third thing that I always check is their APOE genotype, the gene related to Alzheimer’s disease risk that we mentioned in chapter 4. Stephanie’s labs revealed that she had the APOE e4 allele, which is associated with a greater risk of Alzheimer’s disease—and not just one copy, but two (e4/e4), which meant her risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease was up to twelve times greater than that of someone with two copies of the common e3 allele. The e2 version of APOE appears to protect carriers against Alzheimer’s disease: 10 percent reduced risk for someone with e2/e3, and about 20 percent for e2/e2. Stephanie was unlucky.

- The more of these networks and subnetworks that we have built up over our lifetime, via education or experience, or by developing complex skills such as speaking a foreign language or playing a musical instrument, the more resistant to cognitive decline we will tend to be. The brain can continue functioning more or less normally, even as some of these networks begin to fail. This is called “cognitive reserve,” and it has been shown to help some patients to resist the symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease. It seems to take a longer time for the disease to affect their ability to function. “People that have Alzheimer’s disease and are very cognitively engaged, and have a good backup pathway, they’re not going to decline as quickly,” Richard says.

- There is a parallel concept known as “movement reserve” that becomes relevant with Parkinson’s disease. People with better movement patterns, and a longer history of moving their bodies, such as trained or frequent athletes, tend to resist or slow the progression of the disease as compared to sedentary people. This is also why movement and exercise, not merely aerobic exercise but also more complex activities treatment/prevention strategy for like boxing workouts, are a primary Parkinson’s. Exercise is the only intervention shown to delay the progression of Parkinson’s.

- The brain is a greedy organ. It makes up just 2 percent of our body weight, yet it accounts for about 20 percent of our total energy expenditure. Its eighty-six billion neurons each have between one thousand and ten thousand synapses connecting them to other neurons or target cells, creating our thoughts, our personalities, our memories, and the reasoning behind both our good and bad decisions. There are computers that are bigger and faster, but no machine yet made by man can match the brain’s ability to intuit and learn, much less feel or create. No computer possesses anything approaching the multidimensionality of the human self. Where a computer is powered by electricity, the beautiful machine that is the human brain depends on a steady supply of glucose and oxygen, delivered via a huge and delicate network of blood vessels. Even slight disruptions to this vascular network can result in a crippling or even fatal stroke.

- WHAT’S GOOD FOR THE HEART IS GOOD FOR THE BRAIN. That is, vascular health (meaning low apoB, low inflammation, and low oxidative stress) is crucial to brain health.

* WHAT’S GOOD FOR THE LIVER (AND PANCREAS) IS GOOD FOR THE BRAIN. Metabolic health is crucial to brain health.
* TIME IS KEY. We need to think about prevention early, and the more the deck is stacked against you genetically, the harder you need to work and the sooner you need to start. As with cardiovascular disease, we need to play a very long game.
* OUR MOST POWERFUL TOOL FOR PREVENTING COGNITIVE DECLINE IS EXERCISE.

- At the other end of the spectrum, if you’re someone like me who has been exercising since kindergarten, I promise you these chapters will offer you insights about how to better structure your program—not to achieve a faster marathon time or bragging rights at your gym, but to live a longer and better life, and most important, a life in which you can continue enjoying physical activity well into your later years. — It’s obviously not a revelation that exercise is good for you; so is chicken soup if you have a sore throat. But not many people realize how profound its effects really are. Study after study has found that regular exercisers live as much as a decade longer than sedentary people. Not only do habitual runners and cyclists tend to live longer, but they stay in better health, with less morbidity from causes related to metabolic dysfunction. For those who are not habitual exercisers (yet), you’re in luck: The benefits of exercise begin with any amount of activity north of zero—even brisk walking—and go up from there. Just as almost any diet represents a vast improvement over eating only fast food, almost any exercise is better than remaining sedentary.

- Let’s start with cardiorespiratory or aerobic fitness. This means how efficiently your body can deliver oxygen to your muscles, and how efficiently your muscles can extract that oxygen, enabling you to run (or walk) or cycle or swim long distances. It also comes into play in daily life, manifesting as physical stamina. The more aerobically fit you are, the more energy you will have for whatever you enjoy doing—even if your favorite activity is shopping.

- Our human body has an amazing ability to respond to the demands placed on it. Let’s say I’m just sitting on the couch, watching a movie. At rest, someone my size might require about 300 ml of oxygen per minute in order to generate enough ATP, the chemical “fuel” that powers our cells, to perform all the physiological functions necessary to stay alive and watch the movie. This is a pretty low level of energy demand, but if I go outside and jog around my neighborhood, the energy demands ramp up. My breathing quickens, and my heart rate accelerates to help me extract and utilize ever more oxygen from the air I breathe, in order to keep my muscles working. At this level of intensity, someone my size might require 2,500 to 3,000 ml of oxygen per minute, an eight- to tenfold increase from when I was sitting on the couch. Now, if I start running up a hill as fast as I can, my body’s oxygen demand will increase from there: 4,000 ml, 4,500 ml, even 5,000 ml or more depending on the pace and my fitness level. The fitter I am, the more oxygen I can consume to make ATP, and the faster I can run up that hill.

- The fitter you are, the lower your risk of death. Again, there is no other intervention, drug or otherwise, that can rival this magnitude of benefit. Exercise is so effective against diseases of aging—the Horsemen—that it has often been compared to medicine.

- At a deeper biochemical level, exercise really does act like a drug. To be more precise, it prompts the body to produce its own, endogenous drug-like chemicals. When we are exercising, our muscles generate molecules known as cytokines that send signals to other parts of our bodies, helping to strengthen our immune system and stimulate the growth of new muscle and stronger bones. Endurance exercise such as running or cycling helps generate another potent molecule called brain-derived neurotrophic factor, or BDNF, that improves the health and function of the hippocampus, a part of the brain that plays an essential role in memory. Exercise helps keep the brain vasculature healthy, and it may also help preserve brain volume.

- I think of strength training as a form of retirement saving. Just as we want to retire with enough money saved up to sustain us for the rest of our lives, we want to reach older age with enough of a “reserve” of muscle (and bone density) to protect us from injury and allow us to continue to pursue the activities that we enjoy. It is much better to save and invest and plan ahead, letting your wealth build gradually over decades, than to scramble to try to scrape together an individual retirement account in your late fifties and hope and pray that the stock market gods help you out. Like investing, strength training is also cumulative, its benefits compounding. The more of a reserve you build up, early on, the better off you will be over the long term.

- Richard Feynman being asked at a party to explain, briefly and simply, why he was awarded his Nobel Prize. He responded that if he could explain his work briefly and simply, it probably would not have merited a Nobel Prize.

- There are forty thousand diet books on Amazon; they can’t all be right. I encourage my patients to avoid using the term diet at all, and if I were a dictator, I might ban it entirely. It’s not about telling you what to eat; it’s about figuring out what works for your body and your goals—and, just as important, what you can stick to.

- Are you undernourished, or overnourished? 2. Are you undermuscled, or adequately muscled? 3. Are you metabolically healthy or not? The correlation between poor metabolic health and being overnourished and undermuscled is very high. Hence, for a majority of patients the goal is to reduce energy intake while adding lean mass. This means we need to find ways to get them to consume fewer calories while also increasing their protein intake, and to pair this with proper exercise. This is the most common problem we are trying to solve around nutrition. When my patients are undernourished, it’s typically because they are not taking in enough protein to sustain muscle mass, which as we saw in the previous chapters is a crucial determinant of both lifespan and healthspan. So any dietary intervention that compromises muscle, or lean body mass, is a nonstarter—for both the under- and overnourished groups.

- Years of experience, with myself and my patients, have led me to temper my expectations a bit. Nutritional interventions can be powerful tools with which to restore someone’s metabolic equilibrium and reduce risk of chronic disease. But can they extend and improve lifespan and healthspan, almost magically, the way exercise does? I’m no longer convinced that they can. I still believe that most people need to address their eating pattern in order to get control of their metabolic health, or at least not make things worse.

- Nutrition is relatively simple, actually. It boils down to a few basic rules: don’t eat too many calories, or too few; consume sufficient protein and essential fats; obtain the vitamins and minerals you need; and avoid pathogens like E. coli and toxins like mercury or lead.

- Our knowledge of nutrition comes primarily from two types of studies: epidemiology and clinical trials. In epidemiology, researchers gather data on the habits of large groups of people, looking for meaningful associations or correlations with outcomes such as a cancer diagnosis, cardiovascular disease, or mortality. These epidemiological studies generate much of the diet “news” that pops up in our daily internet feed, about whether coffee is good for you and bacon is bad, or vice versa.

- The problem is that epidemiology is incapable of distinguishing between correlation and causation. This, aided and abetted by bad journalism, creates confusion. For example, multiple studies have found a strong association between drinking diet sodas and abdominal fat, hyperinsulinemia, and cardiovascular risk. Sounds like diet soda is bad stuff that causes obesity, right? But that is not what those studies actually demonstrate, because they fail to ask an important question: Who drinks diet soda? People who are concerned about their weight or their diabetes risk, that’s who. They may drink diet soda because they are heavy, or worried about becoming heavy. The problem is that epidemiology is not equipped to determine the direction of causality between a given behavior (e.g., drinking diet soda) and a particular outcome (e.g., obesity) any more than one of my chickens is able to scramble the egg she has just laid for

- The point is that humans are terrible study subjects for nutrition (or just about anything else) because we are unruly, disobedient, messy, forgetful, confounding, hungry, and complicated creatures. This is why we rely on epidemiology, which derives data from observation and often from the subjects themselves. As we saw earlier, the epidemiology around exercise passes the Bradford Hill criteria with flying colors—but using epidemiology to study nutrition often flunks those tests miserably, beginning with the effect size, the power of the association, often expressed as a percentage. While the epidemiology of smoking (like exercise) easily passes the Bradford Hill tests because the effect size is so overwhelming, in nutrition the effect sizes are typically so small that they

- Second, and far more damning, is that the raw data on which these conclusions are typically based are shaky at best. Many nutritional epidemiological studies collect information on subjects via something called a “food frequency questionnaire,” a lengthy checklist that asks users to recall everything they ate over the last month, or even the last year, in minute detail. I’ve tried filling these out and it’s almost impossible to recall exactly what I ate two days ago, let alone three weeks.\[\*4\] So how reliable can studies based on such data possibly be? How much confidence do we have in, say, the red meat study? So do red and processed meats actually cause cancer or not? We don’t know, and we will probably never get a more definitive answer, because a clinical trial testing this proposition is unlikely ever to be done. Confusion reigns. Nevertheless, I’m going to stick my neck out and assert that a risk ratio of 1.17 is so minimal that it might not matter that much whether you eat red/processed meats versus some other protein source, like chicken. Clearly, this particular study is very far from providing a definitive answer to the question of whether red meat is “safe” to eat. Yet people have been fighting about it for years.

- Allison created a randomized experiment using these mice, similar to the caloric restriction experiments we discussed in chapter 5. He split them into three groups, differing only in the quantity of food they were given: a lowcalorie group, a medium-calorie group, and a high-calorie, ad libitum group of animals who were allowed to eat as much as they wanted. The low-calorie mice were found to live the longest, followed by medium-calorie mice, and the high-calorie mice lived the shortest, on average. This was the expected result that had been well established in many previous studies. But then Allison did something very clever. He looked more closely at the high-calorie group, the mice with no maximum limit on food intake, and analyzed this group separately, as its own nonrandomized epidemiological cohort. Within this group, Allison found that some mice chose to eat more than others—and that these hungrier mice actually lived longer than the highcalorie mice who chose to eat less. This was exactly the opposite of the result found in the larger, more reliable, and more widely repeated randomized trial. There was a simple explanation for this: the mice that were strongest and healthiest had the largest appetites, and thus they ate more. Because they were healthiest to begin with, they also lived the longest. But if all we had to go on was Allison’s epidemiological analysis of this particular subgroup, and not the larger and better-designed clinical trial, we might conclude that eating more calories causes all mice to live longer, which we are pretty certain is not the case.

- These are more rigorous than epidemiology, and they offer some ability to infer causality thanks to the process of randomization, but they too are often flawed. There’s a trade-off between sample size, study duration, and control. To do a long study in a large group of subjects, you essentially have to trust that they are following the prescribed diet, whether the Big Mac diet in our hypothetical example from above, or a simple low-fat diet. If you want to ensure that your subjects are actually eating the diet, you need to feed each subject, observe them eating, and keep them locked in the metabolic ward of a hospital (to be sure they are not eating anything else). All of this is doable, but only for a handful of subjects for a few weeks at a time, which is not nearly a large enough sample or long enough duration to infer anything beyond mechanistic insights about nutrients and health.

- In other words, if you are overnourished, and statistically speaking about two-thirds of us are, you will need to apply at least one of these methods of caloric reduction: deliberately tracking (and reducing) what you eat; cutting out certain foods; and/or giving yourself less time in which to eat. That’s it. Breaking down our approach to nutrition to these three strategies allows us to speak about dietary interventions more objectively, instead of relying on labels such as “low-fat” or “Mediterranean” that don’t tell us very much. If we modify none of these variables—eating whatever we want, whenever we want, in as great a quantity as we want—we end up right back at the SAD.

- How many calories you consume has a huge impact on everything else we’re talking about in this book. If you’re ingesting one thousand extra calories a day, of anything, you’re going to have problems sooner or later. In prior chapters, we’ve seen how excess calories contribute to many chronic diseases, not only metabolic disorders but also heart disease, cancer, and Alzheimer’s disease. We also know from decades of experimental data (chapter 5) that eating fewer calories tends to lengthen lifespan, at least in lab animals such as rats and mice—although there is debate over whether this represents true lifespan extension or an elimination of the known hazards of overfeeding, the default state of the control animals in most of these experiments.

- One slight advantage is that calorie counting is agnostic to food choices; you can eat whatever you want so long as you stay within your daily allowance. But if you make too many poor decisions, you will be very hungry, so buyer beware. You can lose weight on a restricted-calorie diet consisting only of Snickers bars, but you will feel much better if you opt for steamed broccoli and chicken breasts instead.

- In July of 2009, a study published in Science found that rhesus monkeys that had been fed a reduced-calorie diet for more than two decades had lived markedly longer than those who were allowed to eat freely. “Dieting Monkeys Offer Hope for Living Longer,” declared the headline on the front page of The New York Times. The accompanying photos told the story: on the left was a monkey named Canto, looking trim and spry at the relatively advanced age of twenty-seven, while on the right sat Owen, just two years older but looking like Canto’s flabby, dissipated uncle. Canto had been on a calorically restricted diet for most of his life, while Owen had eaten just about as much food as he wanted. Owen and Canto were two of seventy-six monkeys in this study, begun two decades earlier at the University of Wisconsin–Madison. Half of the monkeys (the control group) were fed ad libitum, meaning they could eat as much food as they wanted, while the other half were placed on a “diet” allowing them about 25 percent fewer calories than the controls. They then lived out their lives as the researchers observed them growing older. Aging studies tend to be about as exciting as watching paint dry, but the end results were pretty dramatic. In the end, the calorically restricted monkeys lived significantly longer and proved far less likely to die of agerelated diseases than the ad libitum–fed control monkeys. They were healthier by many other measures, such as insulin sensitivity. Even their brains were in better shape than those of the controls, retaining more gray matter as they aged. “These data demonstrate that caloric restriction slows aging in a primate species,” the study authors concluded. Case closed, or so it seemed.

- A more significant issue with DR is that everyone’s metabolism is different. Some people will lose tremendous amounts of weight and improve their metabolic markers on a low-carbohydrate or ketogenic diet, while others will actually gain weight and see their lipid markers go haywire—on the exact same diet.

- Steve Rosenberg used to say when a patient’s cancer progressed despite treatment: The patient has not failed the treatment; the treatment has failed the patient.

- Unlike carbs and fat, protein is not a primary source of energy. We do not rely on it in order to make ATP,\[\*8\] nor do we store it the way we store fat (in fat cells) or glucose (as glycogen). If you consume more protein than you can synthesize into lean mass, you will simply excrete the excess in your urine as urea. Protein is all about structure. The twenty amino acids that make up proteins are the building blocks for our muscles, our enzymes, and many of the most important hormones in our body. They go into everything from growing and maintaining our hair, skin, and nails to helping form the antibodies in our immune system. On top of this, we must obtain nine of the twenty amino acids that we require from our diet, because we can’t synthesize them.

- How much protein do we actually need? It varies from person to person. In my patients I typically set 1.6 g/kg/day as the minimum, which is twice the RDA. The ideal amount can vary from person to person, but the data suggest that for active people with normal kidney function, one gram per pound of body weight per day (or 2.2 g/kg/day) is a good place to start—nearly triple the minimal recommendation. So if someone weighs 180 pounds, they need to consume a minimum of 130 grams of protein per day, and ideally closer to 180 grams, especially if they are trying to add muscle mass. This is a lot of protein to eat, and the added challenge is that it should not be taken in one sitting but rather spread out over the day to avoid losing amino acids to oxidation (i.e., using them to produce energy when we want them to be available for muscle protein synthesis). The literature suggests that the ideal way to achieve this is by consuming four servings of protein per day, each at ~0.25 g/lb of body weight. A six-ounce serving of chicken, fish, or meat will provide about 40 to 45 grams (at about 7 grams of actual protein per ounce of meat), so our hypothetical 180-pound person should eat four such servings a day.

- How much protein you need depends on your sex, body weight and lean body mass, activity level, and other factors, including age. There is some evidence that older people might require more protein because of the anabolic resistance that develops with age—that is, their greater difficulty in gaining muscle. Unfortunately, there’s no CGM for protein, so it becomes a bit of a process of trial and error. I try to consume enough to maintain muscle mass as I train. If I find that I’m losing muscle mass, then I endeavor to eat more. Older people in particular should try to keep track of their lean mass, such as via a body-composition-measuring scale (or better yet, DEXA scan), and adjust their protein intake upwards if lean mass declines. For me and my patients, this works out to four servings, as described, with at least one of them being a whey protein shake. (It’s very difficult for me to consume four actual meals. Typically, I will consume a protein shake, a high-protein snack, and two protein meals.)

- In particular, plant protein has less of the essential amino acids methionine, lysine, and tryptophan, potentially leading to reduced protein synthesis. Taken together, these two factors tell us that the overall quality of protein derived from plants is significantly lower than that from animal products. The same is true of protein supplements. Whey protein isolate (from dairy) is richer in available amino acids than soy protein isolate. So if you forgo protein from animal sources, you need to do the math on your protein quality score.

- While carbohydrates are primarily a source of fuel and amino acids are primarily building blocks, fats are both.

- This kind of fasting is called “hypocaloric” because you are not truly fasting in the sense of eating no food at all. You are eating just enough to quell the worst hunger pangs, but not so much that your body thinks you are fully fed. For twenty-five days out of each month, Tom ate a “normal” diet (though in his case, very starch- and sugar-restricted), and only between noon and 8 p.m.; during his fasting week, a typical day’s menu might consist of a salad with light dressing, an avocado, and some macadamia nuts or olives. He was surprised at how good he felt. “It wasn’t as horrific as I thought it was going to be,” he told me later. “After day three, the hunger disappears.” It did not take long for his blood biomarkers to improve dramatically: where his complete blood chemistry report used to be largely yellow and red —meaning, most of his values were borderline to “bad”—it is now almost entirely green. His lipids are under control, and his liver enzymes have plummeted back to safe, normal ranges. After several cycles of this, he was able to do things like climb a flight of steps or walk several city blocks again without feeling out of breath. His blood pressure is lower, and he has been able to stop taking many of the countless medications he was on. Last, he now weighs sixty-seven pounds less than he used to, a sign that his metabolic health really is back on track, and a powerful incentive for him to keep at it. “The weight just poured off,” he told me. Fasting had effectively reset or rebooted his crashed metabolism in a way that no other dietary intervention was able to achieve. Because it has such deleterious effects on muscle mass, I only use it in hard-to-fix patients like Tom. Tom was so overweight to begin with that he could tolerate the loss of muscle because he was losing so much fat at the same time. But most people can’t safely lose muscle mass, so fasting is a tool that we can only really use in extremis, when there are no other viable options.

- Nutritional biochemistry is an important component of our tactics, but it is not the only path to longevity, or even the most powerful one. I see it more as a rescue tactic, particularly for patients like Eduardo and Tom, with really severe metabolic problems such as NAFLD and type 2 diabetes. It is also essential for older people who need to build or maintain muscle mass. But its power to leverage increased lifespan and healthspan is more limited. Bad nutrition can hurt us more than good nutrition can help us. If you’re already metabolically healthy, nutritional interventions can only do so much.

- Protein is actually the most important macronutrient, the one macro that should not be compromised. Remember, most people will be overnourished—but also undermuscled. It is counterproductive for them to limit calories at the expense of protein and hence muscle mass.

- Decimation of sleep throughout industrialized nations is having a catastrophic impact on our health, our life expectancy, our safety, our productivity, and the education of our children,” declares Matthew Walker, director of the Center for Human Sleep Science at the University of California at Berkeley, in his book Why We Sleep. I’ve found that my own patients’ health problems can often be traced to poor sleep—and that fixing their sleep issues makes our other tactics more effective.

- Over dinner one night in 2012, I had been arguing to Kirk that five to six hours a night was more than enough sleep, and if I didn’t feel tired, then I didn’t need more sleep. In fact, I went so far as to declare that it was a pity that we needed to waste time in bed at all. Imagine how much more we could accomplish if we just cut out sleep entirely! There I was again, bravely ascending the flanks of Mount Stupid. But Kirk stopped me short with a simple, Socratic question. If sleep is so unimportant, he asked, then why hasn’t evolution gotten rid of it?

- Demonstrates precisely why sleep is so important. Why would evolution allow us to spend up to a third of our lives in a state of unconsciousness, where we could easily be killed or eaten? He pressed the issue: Don’t you think natural selection would have eliminated the need to sleep hundreds of millions of years ago—unless, somehow, it was absolutely essential? He was so right that it was as if he had struck a gong inside my brain. Every animal engages in some form of sleep; scientists have found no exceptions, so far. Horses can do it standing up; dolphins sleep one half of their brain at a time; and even great white sharks, who never stop moving, spend time in a sleep-like, restful state. Elephants sleep only four hours per day, while the brown bat snoozes for nineteen hours per twenty-four, which strikes me as perhaps a bit too much, but the point is that every animal that has been carefully studied to date sleeps in some way. Kirk was correct: evolutionarily, sleep is non-negotiable.

- when was the last time you woke up feeling that way? This morning? Last week? Last month? You can’t remember? If this is you, then you need to be taking stock of your sleep patterns and sleep quality, and working to fix them—just as much as you should address your lipoproteins, your metabolic health, or your markers of physical fitness. It’s that important.

- Good sleep is like a performance-enhancing drug. In one study, Stanford basketball players were encouraged to strive for ten hours of sleep per day, with or without naps, and to abstain from alcohol or caffeine. After five weeks, their shooting accuracy had improved by 9 percent, and their sprint times had also gotten faster.\[\*1\] LeBron James makes sleep a key part of his recovery routine, always trying for nine and sometimes ten hours of sleep per night, plus a daily nap. “When you get in that good sleep, you just wake up, and you feel fresh,” he has said. “You don’t need an alarm clock. You just feel like, okay, I can tackle this day at the highest level that you can get to.”

- Higher stress levels can make us sleep poorly, as we all know, but poor sleep also makes us more stressed. It’s a feedback loop. Both poor sleep and high stress activate the sympathetic nervous system,

- Poor sleep also changes the way we behave around food. Studies by Eve van Cauter’s group have found that limiting subjects’ sleep to four or five hours a night suppresses their levels of leptin, the hormone that signals to us that we are fed, while increasing levels of ghrelin, the “hunger” hormone. When we sleep poorly, we can be desperately, irrationally hungry the next day, and more likely to reach for high-calorie and sugary foods than their healthy alternatives. Studies show that people who are more sleep deprived tend to have a higher likelihood of indulging in a fourth meal late in the evening.

- Studies by van Cauter’s group have found that short-sleeping subjects ate about three hundred extra calories’ worth of food the following day, compared with when they were well rested. Taken together, this all adds up to a perfect recipe for the beginnings of NAFLD and insulin resistance.

- The MR data confirmed the observational findings, that sleeping less than six hours a night was associated with about a 20 percent higher risk of a heart attack. Even more noteworthy, the researchers found that sleeping six to nine hours a night (i.e., adequately, by the researchers’ definition) was associated with a reduction in heart attack risk—even among individuals with a high genetic predisposition for coronary artery disease.

- Later in the night, typically, our “submersible” rises back up toward the surface, into a zone called rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. In this state, our eyeballs really will dart around behind our eyelids. We are “seeing” things, but only in our mind. This is where most of our dreaming occurs, as our mind processes images and events that seem familiar but are also strange or dislocated from their typical context. Interestingly, the electrical signature of REM sleep is very similar to that when we are awake; the main difference is that our body is paralyzed, which is probably not accidental, since it prevents us from acting on our bizarre dream thoughts. It wouldn’t be good if we could just get up and run around while we were in REM sleep. (This probably also explains those dreams where we are trying to run away from something and our body just won’t seem to cooperate.)

- When we are young, REM sleep is important in helping our brains grow and develop. Even while we are asleep, our brain is forming new connections, expanding our neural network; this is why younger people spend more time in REM. In adulthood, our REM sleep time tends to plateau, but it remains important, especially for creativity and problem solving. By generating seemingly random associations between facts and memories, and by sorting out the promising connections from the meaningless ones, the brain can often come up with solutions to problems that stumped us the previous day. Research has also found that REM sleep is especially helpful with what is called procedural memory, learning new ways of moving the body, for athletes and for musicians. Another very important function of REM sleep is to help us process our emotional memories, helping separate our emotions from the memory of the negative (or positive) experience that triggered those emotions. This is why, if we go to bed upset about something, it almost always seems better in the morning. We remember the event but (eventually) forget the pain that accompanied it. Without this break for emotional healing, we would live in a state of constant anxiety, every memory triggering a renewed surge of the emotions around that event. If this sounds like PTSD, you are correct: studies of combat veterans found that they are less able to separate memories from emotions, precisely due to their lack of REM sleep. It turned out that the veterans put out high levels of noradrenaline, the fight-or-flight hormone that effectively prevented their brains from relaxing enough to enter REM.\[\*2\]

- Sleep medications such as Ambien and Lunesta do not promote healthy, long-lasting sleep so much as they tend to promote a sleeplike state of unconsciousness that does not really accomplish much if any of the brain-healing work of either REM or deep sleep. One study found that Ambien actually decreased slow-wave sleep (deep sleep) without increasing REM, meaning people who take it are basically trading high-quality sleep for low-quality sleep.

- Like so much else in biology, this has a possible basis in evolution: if all members of a clan or a tribe adhered to the exact same sleep schedule, the entire group would be vulnerable to predators and enemies for several hours every night. Obviously not ideal. But if their sleep schedules were staggered, with some individuals going to bed early while others were more inclined to stay up late and tend the fire, the group as a whole would be much less vulnerable. This may also explain why teenagers want to go to bed late and then sleep in: Our chronotype appears to undergo a temporary shift in adolescence toward late sleeping and later rising. School start times, unfortunately for both teens and for those of us who are parents, remain stubbornly fixed at very early hours—but there is a growing nationwide movement to push school times later, to better suit adolescent sleep schedules.

- Most important, you must create an environment for yourself that is conducive to sleeping well. The first requirement for good sleep is darkness. Light is the enemy of sleep, full stop. Thus, you want to make your bedroom itself as dark as possible—installing room-darkening curtains if you live somewhere with a lot of outdoor evening light, and removing all light sources in the bedroom, even down to electronic equipment like TVs and cable boxes and such. Their little pinpoint LEDs are more than bright enough to keep you from sleeping well. Digital clocks are especially deadly, not only because of their bright numerals but also because if you wake up and see that it’s 3:31 a.m., you might start worrying about your 7 a.m. flight and never fall back asleep.

- The devices we stare at before bed—phones, laptops, video games—are even worse for our sleep. Not only do they bombard us with more blue light, but they also activate our minds in ways that impede our ability to sleep. One large-scale survey found that the more interactive devices subjects used during the hour before bedtime, the more difficulties they had falling asleep and staying asleep—whereas passive devices such as TV, electronic music players, and, best of all, books were less likely to be associated with poor sleep. This may partially explain why watching TV before bed does not seem to affect sleep quite as negatively as playing video games or scrolling social media does, according to research by Michael Gradisar, a sleep researcher and professor of psychology at Flinders University in Australia.

- Turn off the computer and put away your phone at least an hour before bedtime. Do NOT bring your laptop or phone into bed with you.

- Another very important environmental factor is temperature. Many people associate sleep with warmth, but in fact the opposite is true: One of the signal events as we are falling asleep is that our body temperature drops by about one degree Celsius. To help that happen, try to keep your bedroom cool—around sixty-five degrees Fahrenheit seems to be optimal. A warm bath before bed may actually help with this process, not only because the bath itself is relaxing but also because when we get out of the bath and climb into our cool bed, our core temperature drops, which signals to our brain that it is time to fall asleep. (There are also a variety of cooling mattresses and mattress toppers out there that could help people who like to sleep cool.)

- The effects of alcohol on memory and cognition are apparent even in moderate drinkers. Studies have found that young people who drink heavily are more likely to forget even basic tasks like locking the door or mailing a letter. Students who averaged nine drinks per week (not much, by collegiate standards) performed worse on a word-based memory test. And, in a finding that will surprise no one, students who drank more slept later and felt sleepier in the daytime, as well as performing worse on tests. More alarming is the finding that students who drank heavily two days after a bout of learning or study forgot or failed to retain most of what they had learned.

- Coffee is not a solution to the problem of poor sleep, especially if consumed to excess or (especially) at the wrong time. Most people think of caffeine as a stimulant that somehow gives us energy, but actually it functions more as a sleep blocker. It works by inhibiting the receptor for a chemical called adenosine, which normally helps us go to sleep every night.

- Everyone differs in their caffeine tolerance, based on genes and other factors (23andMe tests for one common caffeine-related gene). I’m a very fast metabolizer, so I can handle that afternoon espresso without it affecting my sleep too much; I can even drink coffee after dinner, and it seems to have no impact (unlike alcohol). Someone who metabolizes caffeine slowly should probably stop at one or two cups, before noon.

- It is also important to mentally prepare ourselves for sleeping. For me, this means avoiding anything that might create stress or anxiety, such as reading work emails or especially checking the news. This activates the sympathetic nervous system (the fight-or-flight one) at a time when we want to be destressing and generally winding down. I have to force myself to step away from the computer in the evening; that queue of emails will still be there in the morning. If there’s a burning issue that I can’t get off my mind, I’ll write a few lines about it, creating a plan of action for the next morning. Another way to turn down the sympathetic nervous system and prepare the brain for sleep is through meditation. There are several very good apps that can help with guided meditations, including some that are focused entirely on sleep. The overarching point here is that a good night of sleep may depend in part on a good day of wakefulness: one that includes exercise, some outdoor time, sensible eating (no late-night snacking), minimal to no alcohol, proper management of stress, and knowing where to set boundaries around work and other life stressors.

- How to Improve Your Sleep

- Don’t drink any alcohol, period—and if you absolutely, positively must, limit yourself to one drink before about 6 p.m. Alcohol probably impairs sleep quality more than any other factor we can control. Don’t confuse the drowsiness it produces with quality sleep. 2. Don’t eat anything less than three hours before bedtime—and ideally longer. It’s best to go to bed with just a little bit of hunger (although being ravenous can be distracting.) 3. Abstain from stimulating electronics, beginning two hours before bed. Try to avoid anything involving a screen if you’re having trouble falling asleep. If you must, use a setting that reduces the blue light from your screen. 4. For at least one hour before bed, if not more, avoid doing anything that is anxiety-producing or stimulating, such as reading work email or, God help you, checking social media. These get the ruminative, worry-prone areas of our brain humming, which is not what you want. 5. For folks who have access, spend time in a sauna or hot tub prior to bed. Once you get into the cool bed, your lowering body temperature will signal to your brain that it’s time to sleep. (A hot bath or shower works too.) 6. The room should be cool, ideally in the midsixties. The bed should be cool too. Use a “cool” mattress or one of the many bed-cooling devices out there. These are also great tools for couples who prefer different temperatures at night, since both sides of the mattress can be controlled individually. 7. Darken the room completely. Make it dark enough that you can’t see your hand in front of your face with your eyes open, if possible. If that is not achievable, use an eye shade. I use a silky one called Alaska Bear that costs about $8 and works better than the fancier versions I’ve tried. 8. Give yourself enough time to sleep—what sleep scientists call a sleep opportunity. This means going to bed at least eight hours before you need to wake up, preferably nine. If you don’t even give yourself a chance to get adequate sleep, then the rest of this chapter is moot. 9. Fix your wake-up time—and don’t deviate from it, even on weekends. If you need flexibility, you can vary your bedtime, but make it a priority to budget for at least eight hours in bed each night. 10. Don’t obsess over your sleep, especially if you’re having problems. If you need an alarm clock, make sure it’s turned away from you so you can’t see the numbers. Clock-watching makes it harder to fall asleep. And if you find yourself worrying about poor sleep scores, give yourself a break from your sleep tracker.

- If you find yourself lying awake in bed, unable to get back to sleep, my advice is to stop fighting it. Get up, go into another room and do something relaxing. Fix a cup of tea (noncaffeinated, obviously), and read a (preferably boring) book until you feel sleepy again. The key, says Vikas Jain, is to find something that is relaxing and enjoyable but that serves no function; you never want to give your insomnia a purpose, such as doing work or paying bills, because if you do, your brain will make sure to wake you up for it on a regular basis. Keep in mind, too, that you might not actually have insomnia; you might simply be a night-owl chronotype, thinking you “should” go to bed much earlier than your brain or your body is ready for. So adjust your bedtime and waking time, if possible.

- Another very direct way in which mental health affects lifespan is via suicide, which ranks among the top ten causes of death across all age groups, from our teens into our eighties. When I think of suicide, I often think of a man named Ken Baldwin, who leaped off the Golden Gate Bridge in 1985, when he was twenty-eight. Unlike 99 percent of jumpers from that bridge, he survived. As he fell, he later told the author Tad Friend, “I instantly realized that everything in my life that I’d thought was unfixable, was totally fixable— except for having just jumped.”

- This type of suffering is far more prevalent than suicide rates would suggest. It simply robs you of the joy that enables you to focus on your health, life, and relationships with others, so that instead of living, you are merely waiting to die. This is why I’ve come to believe that emotional health may represent the most important component of healthspan. Nothing else about longevity is really worth much without some degree of happiness, fulfillment, and connection to others. And misery and unhappiness can also destroy your physical health, just as surely as cancer, heart disease, neurodegenerative disease, and orthopedic injury.

- Even just living alone, or feeling lonely, is linked to a much higher risk of mortality. While most issues around emotional health are not age dependent, this is the one emotional health “risk factor” that does seem to grow worse with increasing age. Surveys show that older Americans report spending more time alone every day—an average of about seven hours daily, for those age seventy-five—and are far more likely to live alone than people in middle age and younger. And the way things were going for me, I was looking at a sad, lonely, miserable old age.

- This perfectly described how I had felt at certain times in my childhood. The feeling of powerlessness was a large source of my pain (and in later life, my anger). But I also want to make an important distinction between trauma and adversity. They are not the same. I am not suggesting that it is ideal for children to grow up without experiencing any adversity at all, which sometimes seems to be a primary goal of modern parenting. Many stressors can be beneficial, while others are not. There is no bright line between trauma and adversity; terrible as it was, my own experience had made me stronger in some ways. Julie’s question is a pretty good litmus test: Would I want my child to experience it? If my daughter finished dead last in a cross-country race (for example), and didn’t get a medal, that would be okay. Sure, she might feel upset in the moment, but it could also motivate her to train harder and give her a better appreciation for the joy of placing in the top three one day. What would not be okay is if I had then screamed at her, in front of the other runners, for getting beaten by the shortest kid on the team.

- Just as an aside, a 2019 study provides an elegant demonstration of the principle that setbacks can be net positive. The researchers looked at junior scientists who had applied for NIH grants and separated them into two groups: One group had scored just above the threshold for funding, while the other had scored just below the funding line, meaning their grants were not funded. While the near-miss group were more likely to drop out of science in the immediate aftermath, those who stuck with it eventually outperformed their peers who had received funding on their first try. The early setback had not impaired their careers but may have had an opposite effect.

- The most important thing about childhood trauma is not the event itself but the way the child adapts to it. Children are remarkably resilient, and wounded children become adaptive children. The problems begin when these adaptive children grow up to become maladaptive, dysfunctional adults. This dysfunction is represented by the four branches of the trauma tree: (1) addiction, not only to vices such as drugs, alcohol, and gambling, but also to socially acceptable things such as work, exercise, and perfectionism (check); (2) codependency, or excessive psychological reliance on another person; (3) habituated survival strategies, such as a propensity to anger and rage (check); (4) attachment disorders, difficulty forming and maintaining connections or meaningful relationships with others (check). These branches are often fairly obvious and easy to spot; the tricky part is digging down to the roots and beginning to disentangle them. All of this is highly individual; everyone responds and adapts to trauma in a unique way. And it’s not as if there is some sort of pill that can make someone’s trauma, or their adaptations to it, simply go away. It requires hard work—and, as I would come to understand, it can also take a very long time.

- This comes in handy almost every single day. For example, if my wife comes home and snips at me because I didn’t help put away the groceries, my tendency might be to think, Hey, I’m working really hard and I can’t always pitch in. And that sense of entitlement would sneak up inside me because, well, I am working very hard, and someone else can put away the groceries. But then I ask myself, Wait, what has Jill’s day been like today? She had to pick up our boys from school and take them to the grocery store, where they probably fought like wild animals and made everyone in the store think Jill is the worst mother on the planet because she can’t control her spoiled little brats, while she stood in line at the deli counter just to get me the perfectly sliced deli meat that can’t be found with the prepackaged deli meat, and then on the way home she hit every single red light while the boys threw Lego bricks at each other. And you know what? When I view it through her lens, I quickly get over myself and realize that I’m the one who’s being selfish and that next time I have to do better. That’s the power of reframing. You realize that you have to step back from a situation, temper your reflexive reaction, and try to see what is actually happening. Somewhere along the line, in a random airport on a long work trip, I had picked up David Brooks’s book The Road to Character. On the plane, I read the part where Brooks makes a key distinction between “résumé virtues,” meaning the accomplishments that we list on our CV, our degrees and fellowships and jobs, versus “eulogy virtues,” the things that our friends and family will say about us when we are gone. And it shook me. For my entire life, I had been accumulating

- But I had also recently attended a funeral for a woman about my age who had died of cancer, and I was struck by how lovingly and movingly her family had spoken about her—with hardly a mention of her impressive professional or educational success. What mattered to them was the person she had been and the things she had done for others, most of all her children.

- There’s a quote from Paulo Coelho that I think about often: “Maybe the journey isn’t so much about becoming anything,” he writes. “Maybe it’s about unbecoming everything that isn’t really you, so you can be who you were meant to be in the first place.”

- “I think people get old when they stop thinking about the future,” Ric told me. “If you want to find someone’s true age, listen to them. If they talk about the past and they talk about all the things that happened that they did, they’ve gotten old. If they think about their dreams, their aspirations, what they’re still looking forward to—they’re young.”
