## Summary

## Important quotes

### HOW TO BETTER FOCUS :

1\. PUT YOUR PHONE OUT OF SIGHT
2\. MIND YOUR ENVIRONMENT

- Modifying your environment is one of the top ways to cultivate your focus. The most focus-conducive environments are those in which you’re interrupted and distracted the least.

3\. MAKE A DISTRACTIONS LIST

- Maintaining a distractions list as you read will capture the important things that float to the surface of your consciousness. Writing them down to make sure they don’t slip through the cracks will let you refocus on the task at hand.
- Just as you are what you eat, you are what you pay attention to. Attention is finite and is the most valuable ingredient you have to live a good life—so make sure everything you consume is worthy of it. Bringing awareness to what you consume can provide hours of extra time each day.

5\. CONSUME SOME CAFFEINE BEFORE READING
6\. GRAB A PEN OR HIGHLIGHTER

- I also read with a highlighter and a pen in hand so I can mark up the book as I read it. The number of highlights and notes on its pages indicates how much I liked it. When I finish that first read, I go through the book a second time, rereading just the highlighted parts so I can really process the most valuable nuggets. If I can, I’ll annoy someone nearby by sharing these bits so I can process them again even more deeply.

7\. WHEN YOU NOTICE YOUR FOCUS WAVERING . .

- when you do notice your focus fading, step back from this book for a few minutes to do something relatively mindless. Whether it’s washing the dishes, people watching, or cleaning the house, you’ll effectively recharge your attention. Once your focus has been reset, return to the book with a fresh mind. And just as you’ve kept a distractions list while you read, make sure you have a place to capture ideas that come to mind during your break. PART

8\. SWITCHING OFF AUTOPILOT MODE

- As many as 40 percent of our actions are habits, which shouldn’t require conscious deliberation. Unless you’re a monk and have the luxury of being able to meditate all day, it’s impossible to live intentionally 100 percent of the time. But some decisions are worth making deliberately. How we manage our attention is one of them.
- The more we can manage our attention with intention, the more focused, productive, and creative we become.
- The most urgent and stimulating things in your environment are rarely the most significant. This is why switching off autopilot mode is so critical. Directing your attention toward the most important object of your choosing—and then sustaining that attention—is the most consequential decision we will make throughout the day. We are what we pay attention to.
- There are two main criteria to consider when categorizing what to focus on: whether a task is productive (you accomplish a lot by doing it) and whether a task is attractive (fun to do) or unattractive (boring, frustrating, difficult, etc.). I’ll refer to this grid quite often, so let’s quickly take a look at each of the four categories of tasks. Necessary work includes tasks that are unattractive yet productive. Team meetings and calls about your quarterly budget fall into this quadrant. We usually have to push ourselves to do this type of work. Unnecessary work includes the tasks that are both unproductive and unattractive—like rearranging the papers on your desk or the
- Spending time on unnecessary work tasks keeps us busy, but such busyness is just an active form of laziness when it doesn’t lead to actually accomplishing anything.
- Distracting work includes stimulating, unproductive tasks and as such is a black hole for productivity. It includes social media, most IM conversations, news websites, watercooler chats, and every other form of low-return distraction. These activities can be fun but should generally be indulged in small doses. The better you become at managing your attention, the less time you’ll spend in this quadrant.
- The remaining box on the chart is purposeful work—the productivity sweet spot. These are the tasks we’re put on earth to do; the tasks we’re most engaged in as we do them; the tasks with which we make the largest impact. Very few tasks fit into this box—most people I’ve encountered have three or four at most. Doing good work in this category usually requires more brainpower, and we are often better at these types of tasks than other people are. An actor’s most purposeful tasks might be to rehearse and perform. A financial adviser’s purposeful tasks might be to make investments, meet with clients, and educate herself on industry trends. A researcher’s most important tasks might include designing and running studies, teaching, and applying for funding. My most important tasks are writing books and blog articles, reading research to encounter new ideas, and giving talks. In your personal life, your purposeful tasks might include spending time with your kids, working on a side hustle,
- Working on autopilot means we are more prone to falling prey to the unnecessary and distracting ones and often spend time on necessary and purposeful work only when we’re on deadline. I noticed something interesting as I applied the research in this book to my own life: as time passed, I began to spend less time on autopilot and focused more attention on my most purposeful and necessary tasks. As you become more deliberate about managing your attention, I think you’ll find the same to be true for your work.

THE LIMITS OF YOUR ATTENTION
Chapter 2

###

- Our environment sends a steady stream of information to our brain every second. Think about the sights, sounds, and other information coming at you in this moment, and you’ll realize there is a nearly infinite number of items at which you could direct your focus. Timothy Wilson, a professor of psychology at the University of Virginia, estimates that our brain receives eleven million “bits” of information in the form of sensory experiences each second.
- But how many of these eleven million bits can our minds consciously process and focus on at once? Just forty of them. Not forty million or forty thousand, but forty.
- The second way that our attention is limited is that after focusing on something, we can hold only a small amount of information in our shortterm memory. The ability to temporarily store information in our minds is practically a superpower, as it’s what enables us to think about what we’re doing as we’re doing it, whether that involves problem-solving tasks (e.g., carrying over digits when doing arithmetic) or planning for the future (e.g., plotting the best sequence of exercises at the gym). Without this temporary mental scratch pad, we’d be mindlessly reacting to whatever was happening in the world around us.
- We can easily hold two things in memory at once, so it’s no accident that combinations of two are found everywhere, from dynamic duos like Batman and Robin to Bert and Ernie to Calvin and Hobbes. The number three also fits comfortably in our attentional space: we award three Olympic medals and grow up with stories like “Goldilocks and the Three Bears,” “The Three Blind Mice,” and “The Three Little Pigs.” The list goes on: we divide these stories into three parts (the beginning, middle, and end) and have sayings like “Good things come in threes,” “Celebrities die in threes,” and “Third time’s the charm.” We also group ideas into fours (the four seasons), fives (the five “love languages”), sixes (the six sides of a die), and sevens (days of the week, deadly sins, and Wonders of the World). Even most phone numbers fit comfortably within this attentional limit: one set of three numbers (or maybe four, if you’re in the United Kingdom), followed by another four digits, making the full number easy to hold in your mind as you dial. You have to dig deep to find common examples of groups larger than seven.
- interesting example: you even blink in accordance with where your attention is directed. You normally blink fifteen to twenty times a minute but do so during natural breaks in your attention—such as at the end of a sentence when reading, when someone you’re speaking with pauses, or at breakpoints when watching a video. This blinking rhythm happens automatically—all you have to do is pay attention to what you’re reading, and your brain’s attentional space takes care of the rest.
- Becoming aware of what you’re thinking about is one of the best practices for managing your attention. The more you notice what’s occupying your attentional space, the faster you can get back on track when your mind begins to wander, which it does a remarkable 47 percent of the time.
- Whether you’re writing an email, taking part in a conference call, watching a TV show, or having dinner with your family, you’re essentially spending half of your time and attention on what’s not in front of you, lost in the past or calculating the future. That’s a lot of time and attention to waste. While there is immense value in letting your mind scatter, most times we’d do better to focus on the present.
- David Cain, puts it, “All thoughts want to be taken seriously, but few warrant it.”
- Simply noticing what is occupying our attentional space has been shown to make us more productive. One study asked participants to read a detective novel and try to solve the crime. It compared readers whose minds wandered without awareness with those whose minds wandered consciously. Solve rates were substantially higher for the group that was aware that their minds had wandered. We perform significantly better on every task when we’re aware that our mind is wandering.
- Every Sunday I like to lump my personal, relatively rote “maintenance tasks” together—tasks that help me maintain who I am, like preparing meals, trimming my nails, and cleaning the house—and do them all in an allotted period of time while listening to podcasts or an audiobook. It’s easily one of my favorite weekly rituals. You can do the same, for example, on your daily commute: if you listen to an audiobook during that routine, hourlong trip, you’ll be able to read an extra book each week by utilizing the attention freed by a habitual task. Habits take up very little attentional space, because they take little thought
- author of Consciousness and the Brain, told me, “If you think of habits such as playing the piano, dressing, shaving, or driving on a familiar route, these are so automatic that they do not seem to prevent any conscious thought.” He says that while habits like these may require some level of conscious initiation, once we begin the behavior, the rest of the process takes care of itself.
- ONE COMPLEX TASK Your most productive tasks—the ones that enable you to accomplish significantly more for every minute you dedicate to them—fall into this category. The more time and attention you spend on these tasks, the more productive you become.

###

ATTENTION OVERLOAD

- Have you ever walked into your kitchen or living room and realized you’ve forgotten why you went there in the first place? You’ve fallen into an attention overload trap. You tried to cram too many things into your attentional space— the TV show that was playing in the background, random thoughts, and the IMDb page you just read—and didn’t have enough space left for your original intention. In this case, you meant to grab the grocery list your partner left on the dining room table.

###

- The best way to avoid this overload is to be more selective with what you permit into your attentional space. On the drive home, shut off the radio, which will enable you to process the day and also remember your intention to pick up bread. At home, pause or mute the TV so you don’t try to continue processing the show and forget that you’re heading to fetch a note that’s in the other room. Making small changes like these allows you to keep your attention on your intention.

###

- The state of your attentional space determines the state of your life. When your attentional space is overwhelmed, you, in turn, feel overwhelmed. When your attentional space is clear, you also feel clear. The tidier you keep your attentional space, the more clearly you think.

###

- productivity means accomplishing what we intend to. If our plan today is to write three thousand words, rock a presentation with our leadership team, and catch up on our email, and we successfully accomplish all of those, we were perfectly productive. Likewise, if we intend to have a relaxing day and manage to do absolutely nothing, we’re again perfectly productive. Being busy doesn’t make us productive. It doesn’t matter how busy we are if that busyness doesn’t lead us to accomplish anything of importance. Productivity is not about cramming more into our days but about doing the right thing in each moment.

###

THE QUALITY OF YOUR ATTENTION

###

- set intentions more often, modify your environment to be less distracting, overcome the mental resistance you have to certain tasks, eliminate distractions before they derail you, and clear the distractions inside your own head. The subsequent chapters cover each of these ideas in turn, but understanding the principles behind them is essential.
- Choosing where your attention is focused and maintaining a clear attentional space accomplishes several things at once. You will accomplish what you intend to much more often; focus more deeply, because you become a better defender of your attentional space; remember more, because you’re able to more deeply process what you’re doing; experience less guilt and doubt, knowing you’ve worked with intention; waste less time working on unimportant things; fall victim to fewer distractions—both external and internal; experience greater mental clarity, reduced stress, and fewer feelings of being overwhelmed; feel a stronger purpose behind your work, because you’ve chosen what’s worthy of your attention (working with intention also prevents you from experiencing feelings of “dullness,” which stem from having a lack of purpose); and develop deeper relationships and friendships as you spend more attention, not just time, with people.

###

THE POWER OF HYPERFOCUS INTRODUCING HYPERFOCUS

###

- Hyperfocus is many things at once: it’s deliberate, undistracted, and quick to refocus, and it leads us to become completely immersed in our work. It also makes us immensely happy. Recall how energized you were by your work the last time you found yourself in this state. In hyperfocus you might even feel more relaxed than you usually are when you work.
- When it comes to your most important tasks, the fewer things you pay attention to, the more productive you become.
- HYPERFOCUSING ON HABITS The most important aspect of hyperfocus is that only one productive or meaningful task consumes your attentional space.

###

THE FOUR STAGES OF HYPERFOCUS

###

So How Do We Enter Hyperfocus Mode?

###

- The science suggests we pass through four states as we begin to focus. First, we’re focused (and productive). Then, assuming we don’t get distracted or interrupted, our mind begins to wander. Third, we make note of this mind wandering. This can take awhile, especially if we don’t frequently check what is consuming our attentional space. (On average, we notice about five times an hour that our mind has wandered.) And fourth, we shift our focus back to our original object of attention. ###
- The four stages of hyperfocus are modeled on this framework. To hyperfocus, you must 1. choose a productive or meaningful object of attention; 2. eliminate as many external and internal distractions as you can; 3. focus on that chosen object of attention; and 4. continually draw your focus back to that one object of attention. ###
- the most important step— the more productive and meaningful the task, the more productive and meaningful your actions become. For example, if you set your intention to focus on mentoring a new employee, automating a repetitive task, or brainstorming a new product idea, you’ll be infinitely more productive than if you work intention-free and in autopilot mode. ###
- hyperfocus is about drawing our attention back to the original object of attention when our mind wanders. ###
- it takes an average of twenty-two minutes to resume working on a task after we’re distracted or interrupted. We fare even worse when we interrupt or distract ourselves—in these cases, it takes twenty-nine minutes to return to working on the original task. The more often we assess what’s occupying our attentional space, the quicker we’re able to get back on track. ###
- The best way to become more productive is to choose what you want to accomplish before you begin working. ###
- 1\. The Rule of 3 You can probably skim this section if you’re familiar with material I’ve written in the past. If not, allow me to introduce the Rule of 3: at the start of each day, choose the three things you want to have accomplished by day’s end. While a to-do list is useful to capture the minutiae of the day, these three intention slots should be reserved for your most important daily tasks. ###
- The Rule of 3 is deceptively simple. By forcing yourself to pick just three main intentions at the start of each day, you accomplish several things. You choose what’s important but also what’s not important—the constraints of this rule push you to figure out what actually matters. The rule is also flexible within the constraints of your day. If your calendar is packed with meetings, those commitments may dictate the scope of your three intentions, while an appointment-free day means you can set intentions to accomplish more important and less urgent tasks. When unexpected tasks and projects come your way, you can weigh those new responsibilities against the intentions you’ve already set. Because three ideas fit comfortably within your attentional space, you can recall and remember your original intentions with relative ease. ###
- 2\. Your Most Consequential Tasks A second intention-setting ritual I follow is considering which items on my to-do list are the most consequential. If you have the habit of maintaining a to-do list (which I highly recommend and whose power I will discuss later in the book), take a second to consider the consequences of carrying out each task—the sum of both its short-term and long-term consequences. ###
- If you have a lot of tasks on your to-do list, ask yourself: which are the most consequential? This exercise works well in tandem with the four types of tasks in your work. Once you’ve separated them into the four quadrants of necessary, purposeful, distracting, and unnecessary, ask yourself: Out of the necessary and purposeful tasks, which have the potential to set off a chain reaction? ###
- 3\. The Hourly Awareness Chime Setting three daily intentions and prioritizing your most consequential tasks are great ways to be more intentional every day and week. But how can you ensure you’re working intentionally on a moment-by-moment basis? ###
- My favorite way to make sure I’m staying on track with my intentions is to frequently check what’s occupying my attentional space—to reflect on whether I’m focusing on what’s important and consequential or whether I’ve slipped into autopilot mode. To do so, I set an hourly awareness chime. hourly awareness chime. ###
- The important thing is that you’re regularly checking what’s occupying your attentional space. Set an hourly timer on your phone, smartwatch, or another device—this will easily be the most productive interruption you receive throughout the day. When your hourly chime rings, ask yourself the following: Was your mind wandering when the awareness chime sounded? Are you working on autopilot or on something you intentionally chose to do? (It’s so satisfying to see this improve over time.) Are you immersed in a productive task? If so, how long have you spent focusing on it? (If it was an impressive amount of time, don’t let the awareness chime trip you up—keep going!) What’s the most consequential thing you could be doing right now? Are you working on it? How full is your attentional space? Is it overflowing, or do you have attention to spare? Are there distractions preventing you from hyperfocusing on your work?

###

HOW TO SET STRONGER INTENTIONS

###

- “Make a very detailed plan on how you want to achieve what you want to achieve. What I’m arguing in my research is that goals need plans, ideally plans that include when, where, and which kind of action to move towards the goal.”
- Setting specific intentions can double or triple your odds of success. With that in mind, let’s quickly turn my three vague intentions into implementation intentions: 1. “Go to the gym” becomes “Schedule and go to the gym on my lunch break.” 2. “Quit working when I get home” is reframed as “Put my work phone on airplane mode and my work laptop in another room, and stay disconnected for the evening.” 3. “Get to bed by a reasonable time” becomes “Set a bedtime alarm for 10:00 p.m., and when it goes off, start winding down.”

###

STARTING A HYPERFOCUS RITUAL

###

- To measure how stressed participants felt after multitasking or doing email, Mark and Czerwinski strapped monitors to them to wear twenty-four hours a day to chart their heart-rate variability—a scientifically validated measure of stress. With their permission, Mark and Czerwinski installed a logging program on participants’ computers to observe exactly how often they switched between tasks—every forty seconds. Shockingly, we interrupt ourselves even more often when we keep apps like IM and Skype open—every thirty-five seconds. Their work is worth calling out for a number of reasons. First, in situ research is much more difficult to conduct—it took Mark six years to find an organization that would let her study employees when they went without email for a week, for example—but the approach is particularly worthwhile. As she explained to me, “As opposed to taking someone into a laboratory and setting up artificial conditions to simulate the world, you’re going into the world, and observing things as they actually are.”
- Another study they conducted found that we switch between computer applications 566 times during the average workday.

###

WHY WE LOVE DISTRACTIONS

###

- Once I began viewing my smartphone as just a more distracting computer, I kept it stowed in my laptop bag instead of my pocket. And, most important, I made sure I had a good reason before checking it. This shift in attitude has enabled me to use my phone with intention, rather than on autopilot mode. Every time you pick up your phone without intent, you derail your attention for no good reason. ###
- Clayton Christensen, a professor at Harvard Business School, developed a useful way of assessing the devices in your life: question what “jobs” you “hire” devices to do for you. Every product we buy should do a job for us—we hire Kleenex to blow our nose; Uber to get from one place to another; OpenTable to book a table at a restaurant; [Match.com](http://Match.com) to find a partner. We hire our phones to do a lot of these “jobs,” maybe more than any other product we own. We hire them to be an alarm clock, camera, timepiece, GPS navigator, video game console, email and messaging machine, boarding pass, music player, radio, subway pass, datebook, map, and so much more. It’s no wonder we spend so much time on them. As we accumulate more devices, their jobs can become redundant. The only reason I have a tablet today is because I hire it as my distractions device. If I didn’t need that particular service, it’s likely I would have hired the tablet to do the exact same job done by my phone and computer—helping me surf the web and using social media—and it would have been totally unnecessary. ###
- The average knowledge worker checks his email eleven times per hour—eighty-eight times over the span of a day. It’s hard to get any real work done with so many interruptions. The same study found that employees spend an average of just around thirty-five minutes on email per day—which means that email consumes much more attention than it does actual time. ###
- Seventy percent of emails are opened within the first six seconds of receipt, ###
- Take an “email holiday.” If you’re hunkering down on a big project, set up an autoresponder explaining that you’re on a one-or two-day “email holiday” and that you’re still in the office and can be reached by phone or in person for urgent requests. People are far more understanding of this strategy than you may think. ###
- Use the five-sentence rule. In order to save your time and respect your email recipient’s time, keep each message you write to five sentences or less, and add a note to your email signature explaining that you’re doing so. If you feel the urge to write anything longer, use that as an opportunity to pick up the phone. ###
- Avoiding email distruction ###
- One study that had participants go without email observed that after a period of just one week, their heart-rate variability changed as they became significantly less stressed. The subjects interacted more often with people, spent longer working on tasks, multitasked less, and became much more focused. ###
- A recent study found that, on average, knowledge workers spend 37 percent of their time in meetings— which means that if you work an eight-hour day, you typically spend three hours daily ###
- External environmental cues can affect us in remarkable ways. One study observed coffee shop patrons conversing with one another and discovered that those who kept their phone in front of them checked it every three to five minutes, “regardless of whether it rang or buzzed.” As the study put it, ###
- Since observing how much time and attention I waste on devices like my tablet and smartphone, I’ve rarely kept them in my external environment, unless they serve a purpose. My tablet is currently in another room, and my phone is on a table across my office, well out of reach.\* There’s a lot of stuff in front of me: a meditation cushion, a pair of adjustable dumbbells, several plants, a cup of matcha tea, pictures of family, a fidget cube, a whiteboard, and my turtle, Edward, basking on her\* rock. These things won’t derail my attention for long— they simply aren’t that complex—so, unlike a smartphone, they can’t completely hijack my attention. If I do get distracted by them, it’s much easier to notice that my mind has wandered, and it’s easier for me to get back on track. ###
- To modify your environment to be more conducive to working or living, you should eliminate objects of attention that will potentially derail your focus. Doing this is actually pretty simple: 1. Take stock of the distractions around you. This is especially important in the place where you focus on your most complex work. Make a list of all potential distractions—everything from the tablet you keep by your desk to a coworker sharing your cubicle. Then consider: Which of these do you find more attractive than your work? 2. Distance yourself. Just as with distractions, it’s not possible to tame all environmental cues in advance—but you can control most. Make a plan to remove attractive objects of attention from your environment so you’re not tempted by them. 3. Introduce more productive cues into your environment. Not all environmental cues are bad, and no one wants to work in a sterile environment. Plants, for example, have been shown to have a calming effect—we evolved to feel good in nature, not in cubicles. Hanging a whiteboard in your environment may prompt you to brainstorm your thoughts and is a useful place to write your three daily intentions. Lining up your favorite books on an office shelf might remind you of ideas as you work. Keeping a fidget cube by your side is a cue to occasionally take a break, daydream, and consider new ideas. Having a book on your nightstand, instead of your phone, will encourage you to read more. Storing your fruit in a bowl on the table, instead of in your refrigerator, will prompt you to eat healthier. I f you ask people in what places they’re most productive, few will answer “The office.” ###
- The cleanliness of your environment is also important. Make sure you tidy your space when you’re done with it—coming home to a mess of dishes in the sink and random objects strewn all over the floor will instantly stress you out, reminding you of all the things you still have to do. The same applies when you finish working for the day: tidy the papers on your desk, close the windows on your computer, sort files on your desktop, and act on and archive each email you received that day. When you sit down at your desk the next morning, you’ll be able to focus immediately on your intentions, instead of becoming stressed about the previous day’s progress. Decluttering your digital environment is just as important as decluttering your physical one. ###
- Martin told me, “When you put too much structure in music, you tend to focus on it. The best kind of music exists in the background—there’s really not much going on when you listen closely. The music is linear, changing without you knowing it, and is supporting your work in the game.”

###

MAKING HYPERFOCUS A HABIT

###

- To begin meditating requires just a few minutes each day. Start by determining your resistance level, as you do before hyperfocusing on a task. Then sit in a chair, in a comfortable but upright posture so the disks of your spine are stacked one on top of another. Notice the qualities of your breath and refocus on them whenever your mind wanders. I highly recommend using an app to get started—I like Headspace and Insight Timer, which both feature guided meditations to help you get started. Approach each meditation session with a genuine curiosity about where your mind will wander. My meditation rule is simple, and one I’ve stuck with for years: it doesn’t matter how long I meditate, as long as I do so each day. Some days I can spare only a minute or two, which is sufficient as long as I keep faithful to a routine. When I began a decade ago, I did only five-minute sessions, and since then have slowly built to thirty minutes. I wouldn’t give it up for anything. ###
- Practices like meditation and mindfulness are also powerful because they train you to practice holding a single intention in your mind for a given period of time. ###
- Whether at work or at home, the quality of your attention determines the quality of your life. At work, the more attention you give to what’s in front of you, the more productive you become. At home, the more attention you devote to what’s in front of you, the more meaningful your life becomes. ###
- Shrink your desired hyperfocus period until you no longer feel resistance to the ritual. Minimize the amount of time you’ll dedicate to focusing on one task until you no longer feel mental resistance to it. Even setting a mental deadline of five minutes will likely be enough to get you started. ###
- Notice when you “don’t have time” for something. You always have time—you just spend it on other things. When you find yourself saying this familiar statement, try doing a task swap. For example: if you “don’t have the time” to catch up with a friend over coffee, ask yourself whether you’d have an equal amount of time to watch the football game or surf Facebook. ###
- Continually practice hyperfocus. ###
- hyperfocus is your brain’s most productive mode, scatterfocus is its most creative. ###
- When your mind wanders, it visits three main places: the past, the present, and the future. This is precisely why scattering your attention allows your creativity to flourish as you travel through time and connect what you’ve learned to what you’re doing or what you want to achieve. This enables you to work with greater intention as you consider your future and think about what you should be doing in the present to make it a reality. Even though we spend just 12 percent of our scatterfocus time thinking about the past, we’re more likely to remember these thought episodes, compared with when we think about the present or future. (Fun fact: 38 percent of our pastrelated thoughts connect with earlier-in-the-day events, 42 percent relate to the previous day’s, and 20 percent involve ruminating on what happened in the more distant past.) Our mind is wired to not only perceive but also remember threats, like that one negative email that we can’t forget. (It does this so we learn from our mistakes, though it becomes annoying when it throws random memories at us throughout the day.) ###
- Problem-Crunching Mode Problem-crunching mode is most useful when you’re brainstorming a solution to a specific problem. To enter this mode, hold a problem in your mind and let your thoughts wander around it, turn it over, and explore it from different angles. Whenever your mind ventures off to think about something unrelated or gets stuck on one point, gently nudge your attention back to what you intended to think about, or the problem you intended to solve. ###
- Doing work you love is significantly less exhausting than doing work you don’t care about—focus always feels more forced for the latter. The more you care, the more mileage you’ll get out of your attention. Research also suggests that your mind wanders less when you’re doing something you genuinely enjoy. ###
- The best time to take a break is before you need to. Much as you’re probably already dehydrated when you feel thirsty, your focus and productivity have already dehydrated when you feel thirsty, your focus and productivity have likely already begun to falter by the time you feel fatigued. ###
- For every hour of sleep you miss, you lose two hours of productivity the next day. ###
- Some people claim they’re able to get by with less sleep than everyone else, but chances are either their work isn’t as complex or they’d be capable of accomplishing even more if they were better rested. ###
- Research shows that as we get less sleep, we also feel more pressure at work; focus for a shorter duration of time (even less than forty seconds); fire up social media sites more often; experience more negative moods; actively seek less demanding tasks (eliminating those that no longer fit into our shrunken attentional space); and spend more time online throughout the day. ###
- famous thinkers arrived at solutions to them after being spurred by an external cue. Archimedes figured out how to calculate the volume of an irregular object when he noticed his bathwater overflowing. Newton came up with his theory of gravity when he saw an apple fall from a tree—probably the best-known insight trigger in history. For his habitual scatterfocus routine, renowned physicist and Nobel laureate Richard Feynman would sip 7UP at a topless bar, where he could “‘watch the entertainment,’ and, if inspiration struck, scribble equations on cocktail napkins.” ###
- By learning something new, you transfer dots from your external environment to your memory so you can link them and make use of them later. From the moment you’re born to the day you die, your brain is always engaged in this process. ###
- We are what we pay attention to , and almost nothing influences our productivity and creativity as much as the information we’ve consumed in the past. ###
- having an engaging conversation with someone smarter than you will enable you to collect more valuable dots than doing something like watching TV or reading a gossip magazine. ###
- If you’re a software engineer, taking a course to learn a new programming language or reading a book on managing engineers is obviously a productive use of your time, attention, and energy. Any piece of information that supports your existing skills is a good use of time. The more expansive your constellation of dots, the more valuable connections you’re able to make. Your brain even releases more dopamine, a pleasure chemical, when you consume information that supports what you know. ###
- How do you think your life will be different knowing this piece of information? The tactics in this book are all intended to help you manage your attention deliberately. The same principle applies here—when your creativity is effectively the sum of the dots you connect, consuming information on autopilot mode is one of the least useful activities to engage in. ###
- a book can sometimes take less than ten hours to read, it can take decades to write and may contain a lifetime of lessons that the author has learned and summarized. Books provide access to the highest-quality thinking and most useful dots on pretty much any topic. ###
- here are ten ideas for how you can change your habits to intentionally consume more valuable information. Start by trying two or three that resonate particularly strongly with you. 1. Consume things you care about, especially when few others do. When listing the information you take in, you may have found you enjoy consuming things that other people tend to underappreciate or shy away from. Maybe you love taking coding courses in your spare time—an activity that may feel like a chore for most people. Or you love listening to audiobooks about productivity (I plead guilty). Double down on developing the skills and knowledge that you find entertaining. Also opt for the medium you prefer—if you learn best by listening, try consuming audiobooks instead of physical books; if you prefer visuals, try watching TED talks instead of listening to an audiobook. ###
- 2\. Eliminate some trash. Passively consuming pointless trash adds nothing to your life. Choose two items that don’t bring you genuine enjoyment, and eliminate them entirely. Look out for material that, while stimulating in the moment, doesn’t leave you satisfied afterward. Be ruthless in defending your attention. Every time you stop consuming trash, you make room for something useful to add value to your life. ###
- Choose a few valuable things to add. What useful books can you read, courses can you take, or conversations can you have that might prove useful later? Can you consume more complex information about a certain topic to take your expertise to the next level? What about yourself have you been wanting to improve, or what have been eager to know more about at work or at home? Add something valuable for each worthless thing you eliminate. Push yourself: the most valuable information you can consume is material that challenges you and usually requires your full attention. ###
- Notice what you consume on autopilot mode. Pay special attention to what you pursue when you’re low on energy or as you transition from one task to another. Often these objects of attention are just convenient and don’t add much value to your life. When a friend you’re dining with leaves the table for a few minutes, what apps do you mindlessly open on your phone? Do you reach for your phone as soon as you wake up? What sites do you visit when you’re surfing the internet on autopilot? ###
- Reevaluate what you’re consuming as you’re consuming it. In addition to being more selective about what you consume, you should reevaluate content as you consume it—skipping or skimming anything that’s not worth your time. The Zeigarnik effect makes us want to finish what we start, but every minute we spend on something useless is a minute we lose working on something useful. ###
- Get things to bid for your attention. View the descriptions of podcasts, TV shows, movies, and books as a pitch for your time and attention. You don’t have to listen to every podcast that automatically downloads, every show your DVR records, or every book a friend recommends. Deciding whether something merits your attention takes an extra step, but it’s a decision that will save hours you can then devote to something better. ###
- Invest in serendipity. Consume challenging things outside the boundaries of your expertise, ones that force you to make more disparate connections. The more disparate the dots you connect, the more valuable the connections often end up being. ###
- Set your browser’s homepage to open with Wikipedia’s “random article” bookmark. Look through the AMA (Ask Me Anything) section on Reddit, where world-renowned experts answer popular questions from everyday people. Go see a band you’ve never heard of. Read a book on a topic you know nothing about. Take a class in a subject you’ve always been curious about—like quilting, dancing, or public speaking. Pick up a biography about a historical figure whose dancing, or public speaking. Pick up a biography about a historical figure whose name you know but whose life story you don’t. I signed up for an online course on coding iPhone apps several few months back. Today it’s one of my favorite things to do in my spare time. ###
- there are countless other opportunities to apply scatterfocus during the day: Disconnect from the internet between 8:00 p.m. and 8:00 a.m. Notice when you finish a task, and use that as a cue to scatter your attention for a bit. Buy a cheap alarm clock so you’re not immediately distracted by your phone when you wake up. Walk to get a coffee carrying only a notepad. As a challenge to yourself, leave your phone at home for an entire day. Take an extra-long shower. Make yourself bored for five minutes and notice what thoughts run through your head. Tame distractions and simplify your environment to make sure your attention doesn’t overflow the next time you do a creative hobby. Cook with music playing instead of watching something entertaining. Go for a nature walk. Visit an art gallery. Work out without music or a podcast. ###

- Unhappy people are less productive—full stop. The less happy you are, the more often your mind wanders against your will, and the less attention you bring to what’s in front of you. ###
- Harvard-trained psychologist Shawn Achor found that happier people are 31 percent more productive than those in a negative or neutral state. ###
- It’s worth noting that our minds wander the least when we’re making love— and that we’re significantly happier doing so than we are doing anything else. Nothing else comes close. (To really invest in your attention, try doing all five things at once.) ###
- Shawn Achor, the author of The Happiness Advantage. In the book, and in his TED talk, Shawn offers a few science-backed strategies to bolster your happiness. A few of his top suggestions: Recalling three things you’re grateful for at the end of each day (a good companion tactic to the Rule of 3, discussed in chapter 3) Journaling at the end of each day about one good experience you had Meditating (see chapter 5) Performing a random act of kindness ###

- For most people this occurs during the late morning (around 11:00 a.m.) and midafternoon (around 2:00 or 3:00 p.m.). Our energy is typically lowest right after lunch. Energy levels also fluctuate throughout the week: we’re typically the least engaged with our work on Mondays, when we experience the most boredom, and are the most engaged on Fridays.\* Everyone is different, of course: if you’re an early bird who springs out of bed at 5:00 a.m., your prime time might fall earlier in the day, and afternoons might be the best time for creative work. Similarly, night owls may find they’re most productive when others have long since gone to bed. ###
- consume a bit of caffeine the next time you’re about to hyperfocus on a task or hit the gym for a big workout.\* Instead of having a cup of coffee after you awake, wait until you get to work so you’ll benefit from the boost when you work on your most productive tasks. If you have a brainstorming meeting first thing in the morning, consume caffeine after the session, keeping the walls of your attentional space low to let more ideas flow. If you have a pitch meeting, on the other hand, do the opposite. ###
- when it comes to open-office plans is that if the work you and your team does is hypercollaborative or involves a great deal of creativity and connecting ideas, an open office is probably worth its disadvantages. If your work involves a significant number of tasks that benefit from undisturbed focus, as more and more jobs seem to, an open office can be detrimental to your productivity. productivity. ###
- Hyperfocus can help you get an extraordinary amount done in a relatively short period of time. Scatterfocus lets you connect ideas—which helps you unearth hidden insights, become more creative, plan for the future, and rest. Together they will enable you to work and live with purpose. Your attention is the most powerful tool at your disposal to live and work with greater productivity, creativity, and purpose. Managing it well will enable you to spend more time and energy on your most purposeful tasks and to work more often with intention, focus for longer periods, and stumble into fewer unwanted daydreams.
