## Summary

## Key concepts

## Important quotes

- A mother may be nursing a sick child, and she falls asleep; but before she goes to sleep, she suggests to the subconscious mind that she will awaken if the child’s temperature goes up, or when it needs medicine, or perhaps cries. There may be a thunderstorm going on while the mother sleeps; yet she is not awakened by the storm; however, when the child cries, she is immediately awakened. This is a simple function of the subconscious mind.

- If you can convince the subconscious mind you have no headache, the headache will go away.

- she had psoriasis on her body which would go away by applying an ointment, but that as soon as the salve was discontinued, it would return. She was not resenting anyone; she was very religious, and seemingly well balanced emotionally. In talking to her I discovered that she lived in constant fear of its return. As a matter of fact this was a very powerful suggestion to her subconscious mind, since it is controlled by suggestion and belief; it responded accordingly. She would affirm two or three times a day: “I am whole, pure, and perfect; my skin is perfect; I am healed.” Nothing happened. You can readily see what happened in her case. Every time she said, “My skin is perfect,” it started a quarrel in her mind; something within her said, “No, your skin is not perfect!” The following technique worked for her in a wonderful way. She started to say for five or ten minutes three or four times a day: “It is changing now for the better.” This created no quarrel in her conscious or subconscious mind; results followed; it gradually disappeared, and it has never returned. I am sure she ceased suggesting its return. (What I fear most has come upon me.)

###

- Trust the subconscious mind to heal you. It made your body, and it knows all of its processes and functions.

###

- Blind belief and faith will bring results due to the subjective faith of the individual.

###

- A psychologist friend of mine told me that one of his lungs was infected. X-rays and analysis showed the presence of tuberculosis. At night before going to sleep, he would quietly affirm, “Every cell, nerve, tissue, and muscle of my lungs are now being made whole, pure, and perfect. My whole body is now being restored to health and harmony.” These are not his exact words, but they represent the essence of what he said. A complete healing followed in about a month’s time; subsequent X-rays showed a perfect healing.

###

- I wanted to know his method, so I asked him why he repeated the words prior to sleep. Here is his reply: “The kinetic action of the subconscious mind continues throughout your sleep-time period; hence give the subconscious mind something good to work on as you drop off into slumber.”

###

- Never try to compel the subconscious mind to accept your idea by exercising will power. Such attempts are doomed to failure. The subconscious mind accepts the dominant of two contradictory statements. It is like the man who is poverty stricken saying, “I am wealthy.” In most instances his statement makes him poorer. The simple reason for this is that his belief in poverty is much greater than his belief in abundance, so he is suggesting more lack to himself each time he makes the statement. This illustrates the Law of Reversed Effort. In other words, the opposite result from that which was intended follows.

###

- Assume a comfortable posture, relax your body, and be still. Get into a sleepy state and in that sleepy state say quietly, over and over again as a lullaby, “I am completely free from this habit; sobriety and peace of mind reign supreme.” Repeat the above slowly, quietly, and lovingly for five or ten minutes night and morning. At the end of three weeks he lost all desire to drink. Each time he repeated the above statement its emotional value became greater. When the urge came, he repeated the above formula out loud to himself. By this means he induced the subconscious to accept his idea and a healing followed.

###

- You are a ship, and thought is your helm. Change the direction of the helm (your thought); as a result you change the direction of your ship.

###

- When you think good, good follows; when you think evil, evil follows; these are simple examples of laws of mind.

###

- like money; I love it; I use it wisely, constructively, and judiciously. Money is constantly circulating in my life. I release it with joy, and it returns to me multiplied in a wonderful way. It is good and very good.” This will help you get the right attitude toward money.

###

- Marriage between man and woman should be an act of love. Honesty, sincerity, kindness, and integrity are forms of love. Each should be perfectly honest and sincere with the other. There is not a true marriage when the man marries a woman for her money, social position, or to lift his ego, because there is no sincerity or honesty there. The marriage is not of the heart. When a woman says, “I am tired working; I want to get married, because I want security;” her premise is false; she is not using the laws of mind correctly. Her security depends upon her knowledge of the interaction of the conscious and subconscious mind and its application.

###

- A woman is not dependent on her husband for health, peace, joy, inspiration, guidance, love, wealth, security, happiness, or anything in the world. Her security and peace of mind come from her knowledge of the inner powers within her, and her constant use of the laws of her own mind in a constructive fashion.

###

- Marrying for money or to get even with someone is, of course, a farce and a masquerade.

###

- The little arguments and quarrels which married people engage in will not hurt; it is the sustained grudge or ill feeling which does the damage. When the harsh words said are all forgotten and forgiven a few minutes later, no harm has been done. It is when the feeling of being hurt is prolonged, that the danger lies. If a man begins to brood, grows morbid against his wife, because of the things she said or did, he is committing adultery, since he is mentally engaged in bitterness. This mood will endanger the marriage except he forgives and radiates love and goodwill to his partner. Let the man who is bitter and resentful swallow his sharp remarks; let him go to great length to be considerate, kind, and courteous. He can deftly skirt the differences. Through practice and mental effort, he can get out of the habit of antagonism; then he will be able to get along better not only with his wife, but with business associates also. Assume the harmonious state, and eventually you will find peace and harmony.

###

- Never discuss your marital problems with anyone except a trained counselor. Why have many people thinking negatively of your marriage? Moreover, as you discuss and dwell upon these shortcomings of your husband, you are actually creating these states within yourself. Who is thinking and feeling it? You are! As you think and feel, so are you.

###

- Relatives will usually always give you the wrong advice; it is usually biased and prejudiced, because it is not given in an impersonal way. Any advice you receive which violates the golden rule – which is a cosmic law – is not good or sound. It is well to remember that no two human beings ever lived beneath the same roof without clashes of temperament, periods of hurts, and strain. Never display the unhappy side of your marriage to your friends. Keep your quarrels to yourself. Refrain from criticism and condemnation of your partner. If there are children in the home, let the father praise their mother; let him call attention at times to her fine qualities and the happy aspects of the home. A husband must not try and make his wife over into a second edition of himself. The tactless attempt to change her in many ways is so foreign to her nature; these attempts are always foolish; many times they result in a dissolution of the marriage. These attempts to alter her destroy her pride and self-esteem, and arouse a spirit of contrariness and resentment that proves fatal to the marriage bond.

###

- By resenting and fighting the situation, this woman would only make matters worse. If there is quarreling and bickering in the home, turn your attention away from personalities, environments, and conditions, and focus your attention on your ideal, which is love, peace, and harmony. As you feed your mind upon these ideas, the subconscious mind will respond and bring about harmony.

###

- You will often note that immediately after awakening, the answer will come to you, because you are still half asleep and half awake; there is an outcropping of the wisdom of the subconscious mind at that time.

###

- Remember you have dominion over your environment and conditions. Here is a simple technique which you can follow: Quiet the mind; still the body; tell the body to relax; it has to obey you. It has no volition, initiative, or intelligence of itself; it is an emotional disc which records your beliefs and impressions. Immobilize your attention; focus your thought on the solution to your problem. Try and solve it with your conscious mind. Think how happy you would be about the perfect solution. If your mind wanders, bring it back gently. In this sleepy, drowsy state, say quietly and positively, “The answer is mine now; I know my subconscious mind knows the answer.” Live now in the mood or feeling of the solution. Sense the feeling you would have if the perfect answer were yours now. Let your mind play with this mood in a relaxed way; then drop off to sleep. You may fall asleep sooner than you expected, but you were thinking about the answer; the time was not wasted. When you awaken, and you do not have the answer, get busy about something else. Probably when you are preoccupied with something else the answer will come into your mind, like toast pops out of the toaster.

###

- Remember always this simple truth: The conscious mind has the power of choice; the subconscious does what it is told to do. The latter accepts your beliefs and convictions, and brings them into your experience. It is an infinite, creative power.

###

- Here is a very simple technique used from time immemorial to get an answer from the subconscious mind: Calmly think over what you want, such as, the answer, the harmonious solution, or the right decision. The best time to turn over a request is just before going to sleep. Relax the body; still the wheels of your mind; suggest sleep to yourself. You will begin to feel sleepy, but you are still consciously aware and capable of directing your attention.

###

- “Do the thing you fear, and the death of fear is certain.”

###

- There was a time when the writer of this chapter was filled with unutterable fear when standing before an audience. The way I overcame it was to stand before the audience; do the thing I was afraid to do, and the death of fear was certain. When you affirm positively that you are going to master your fears, and come to a definite decision in your conscious mind that you are going to overcome, you release the power of the subconscious which flows in response to the nature of your thought.

###

- She overcame it by the following technique. Three times a day she isolated herself in a room. She sat down comfortably in an armchair, relaxed her body, and closed her eyes. She stilled the mind and body as best she could. Physical inertia favors mental passivity, and renders the mind more receptive to suggestion. She counteracted the fear suggestion by its converse, saying to herself, “I sing beautifully, I am poised, serene, confident, and calm.” She repeated this statement slowly, quietly, and with feeling from five to ten times at each sitting. She had three such “sittings” every day and one immediately prior to sleep. At the end of a week she was completely poised and confident, and gave a remarkable, wonderful audition. Carry out the above procedure with assurance and conviction, and the death of fear is certain.

###

- Occasionally young men from the local university come to see me, and also school teachers, who seem to suffer from suggestive amnesia at examinations. The complaint is always the same – “I know the answers after the examination is over, but I can’t remember the answers during the examination.”

###

- One young medical student was the most brilliant in his class; yet he found himself failing to answer simple questions at the time of written or oral examinations. I explained to him that the reason was he had been worrying and fearful for several days previous to the examination, these constant negative thoughts became charged with fear. Thoughts enveloped in the powerful emotion of fear are realized in the subconscious. In other words, this young man was requesting his subconscious mind to see to it that he failed, and that is exactly what it did. On the day of the examination he found himself stricken with what is called in psychological circles “suggestive amnesia.”

###

- A French psychologist named Baudouin said, “What we have to work for in overcoming fear is education of the imagination.”

###

- Every night and morning he began to imagine his mother congratulating him on his wonderful record. He would hold an imaginary letter from her in his hand and read congratulatory words. He would also feel the letter in his hand. As he began to contemplate the happy result, he called forth a corresponding or reciprocal response or reaction in himself.

###

- The law of the subconscious mind is compulsion.

###

- I had an experience when I was about ten years of age. I fell accidentally into a pool and went down three times. I can still remember the dark water engulfing my head, and my gasping for air until another boy pulled me out at the last moment. This experience sank into my subconscious mind; for years I feared the water. An elderly psychologist said to me, “Go down to the swimming pool, look at the water, and say out loud in strong tones, ‘I am going to master you, I can dominate you;’ then go into the water, take lessons, and overcome it.” This I did. I learned that when you do the thing you are afraid to do, fear disappears.

###

- “I began to talk to myself saying, ‘John, you can’t surrender to your fear; your fear is a desire for safety or security, for a way out.’”

###

- Never fight negative or fearful thoughts. Always turn on the lamp of love, peace, and confidence within you. Most of our fears are imaginary.
