“If you can change your mind, you can change your life.” ― William James

actions follow thoughts. That means you can’t change your actions without changing your thoughts.

### Highlight (yellow) - Location 143

“I know one thing: That I know nothing,” is what Socrates famously told the Oracle of Delphi when Socrates was declared the wisest man on earth. The fact that he thinks that he knows nothing makes him wise. That’s a way of thinking. French philosopher René Descartes, who lived in the 17thcentury,

we should question the source of our beliefs, not the belief itself. Because most of our beliefs are based on our or other people’s perception.

### Highlight (yellow) - Location 152

How many of your ideas are based on what others have told you? Or based on your first thoughts or assumptions? At the core of thinking lies our ability to separate the truth from falsehood. What is true, what is false? One way to look at that question is to take a pragmatic perspective.

The quality of our thoughts determines the quality of our lives. And our decisions are a result of our thoughts.

“Good things come to those who wait,”

### Highlight (yellow) - Location 203

I ask myself: “Will the outcome of a decision change the way I live?” If you ask that yourself consistently, you’ll find that you automatically filter out useless information and only make decisions that have an actual impact on the outcome of your life. You force yourself to use whatever works—what’s useful. And what impacts your habits.

conventional thinking says that bigger cities also bring you bigger opportunities. I really thought that was true. That’s even the main reason I moved to London. And yes, I did seize a big opportunity for me at the time. But I also had bigger responsibilities and problems. Also, I don’t like big cities. I hate crowded places, dirty air, and unreasonably high cost of living. Clearly, living in a big city didn’t work for me.

Do what works for you.

Only focus on what you control. Things like your: Desires Actions Words Intentions

two main types of useful thoughts: 1. Thinking about how you can solve problems. A problem is just an unanswered question. Put your brain to use and think about how you can solve problems. There are a lot of those on this earth. 2. Understanding knowledge. That means this: Try to internalize knowledge and think about how you can use that knowledge to improve your life, career, work, relationships, etc.

### Highlight (yellow) - Location 242

Commit to stop thinking about useless things. Start taking control of your mind. All that worrying about the past and the future is not going to help you. It never did. And it never will.

### Highlight (yellow) - Location 247

It’s scientific evidence for the idea that your life is a result of your thoughts. The attentional bias states that our perceptions are affected by our thoughts. And naturally, our perceptions determine our actions and decisions, which make up our lives. If you have negative thoughts, you also have a negative perception of life. That’s what it says. Our mind might be illogical, but it’s also simple at the same time.

### Highlight (yellow) - Location 250

If you believe in something, you will try hard to find information, clues, and signs to back that up. In other words, you do everything to prove you’re not wrong.

### Highlight (yellow) - Location 252

Instead of looking at facts, you look at beliefs. And that’s what all cognitive biases do.

### Highlight (yellow) - Location 254

What it comes down to is this: Avoid making decisions based on beliefs, obvious logic, and even science. Scientists are also human beings. That means they have their own cognitive biases. They are notorious for finding evidence for their preconceptions. The solution to making better decisions is not more knowledge. Instead, I’ve found that a pragmatic and neutral perspective leads to better-informed decisions. Unfortunately, there’s no such thing as “the best decision.” If that was the case, we lived in a perfect world full of people who made logical and practical decisions. I like to look at it this way: There are only good-informed and bad-informed decisions.

### Highlight (yellow) - Location 271

I like to avoid assumptions as much as I can. I prefer to look at facts and then draw conclusions. What if you can’t rely on facts? Well, sometimes you just can’t find facts, or you have to make a quick decision. In those (very rare) cases I prefer gut feeling. Whatever you do, never waste your thoughts on other people’s ill-informed opinions and guesses.

I used to think that smart people are fast thinkers. “He thinks on his feet. He’s really smart.” I tried it for many years. Every time I faced a problem, discussion, or when someone asked me a question, I thought, “QUICK, QUICK, QUICK!” Naturally, my first answers sucked. Derek Sivers, one of my favorite thinkers, says he’s a slow thinker: “It’s a common belief that your first reaction is the most honest, but I disagree. Your first reaction is usually outdated. Either it’s an answer you came up with long ago and now use instead of thinking, or it’s triggering a knee-jerk emotional response to something that happened long ago.”

What I’m trying to say is that when someone asks you a question, it’s okay to say, “I don’t know.” You can also say that to yourself. I’ve often been too hard on myself because I didn’t have an instant answer to my personal problems. That doesn’t make you dumb. It makes you human.

### Highlight (yellow) - Location 298

Why are we even afraid that people think we’re stupid? It’s the perfect example of slow thinking. Instead of following your instinct of, “I’ll prove them!” you can take a step back and ask yourself, “Why do I even want to come across as smart?” If you really think about it, it doesn’t matter what others think of you. I think it’s always better to take your time to think. If others think that makes you stupid, they are the ones who are.

Knowing yourself is step one. Step two is acting on that knowledge.

I had a true internal crisis on my hands. Since I had no idea what to do, I started reading more books. And I noticed that many smart and happy people kept journals. They also reflected more on their life. More specifically, they reflected on the things they learned, mistakes they made, and the goals they achieved.

Don’t worry about being a perfectionist—there’s no such thing. More often than not, people are the opposite. Perfectionism is merely an excuse. In reality, we’re scared of what people think of our work.

### Highlight (yellow) - Location 464

When you combine a few rules, you have a system. And a system helps you to take the thinking part out of the equation. The only thinking you need to do is when your system doesn’t give you the results you want. If my system would make me feel bad or gain weight, I would rethink it. And even if it works, a system is never perfect. That’s why I regularly think about what I can change or how I can improve my systems.

But the most important lesson I’ve learned was that you don’t regret what you did in life, you regret what you didn’t do.

it. You can read all the business books you want, and watch as many videos about entrepreneurship as you want, but they will not make you an entrepreneur. Ever. You will only end up living someone else’s life.

Time is limited. Sooner or later we all figure that out. And once we do, we start being more conscious of the way we spend our time. Thinking is a double-edged sword. It can help you. But it can also destroy you. The outcome depends on how you use your thoughts. Your mind is an instrument —nothing more, nothing less. In this book, I shared how I’ve learned to use my brain more effectively. Sometimes you have to think differently, and there are times you must stop thinking altogether. It’s up to you to decide when you should deploy which method. But no matter what you do, don’t spend too much time in thought because that’s a waste of life. At the end of the day, thinking by itself is useless without action.

Effective thoughts? Effective actions. To clarify what I mean, I’ve made a list of what I think are effective thoughts: Making your life better Growing your career and business Visualizing your future Thinking of new ideas Solving problems Coming up with fun things to do with your partner, family, or friends

Just sit down, be one with your thoughts, observe them, and then, ignore them. That’s all there is to meditation.

### Highlight (yellow) - Location 538

I “meditate” all the time—when I walk, exercise, write, wait, sit, lay, whatever. I can always find the time and energy to go within myself to find peace. I don’t need anything to do it. That’s important to realize. I’ve said it before. But it’s so important that I’ll say it again: You don’t need a yoga mat, music, or teacher to help you control your thoughts. You can go within yourself to find calm anytime you want. You also don’t need a holiday, new shoes, or a drink.

### Highlight (yellow) - Location 565

William James himself once said: “The greatest use of a life is to spend it on something that will outlast it.”

### Highlight (yellow) - Location 566

Practically speaking, there’s no purpose to doing something that outlasts you. You won’t be there to see it anyway. But that’s not the point. If we live our lives every day with that idea in mind—that we should strive for doing/creating useful things that matter to others—we end up spending our time on things that actually make a difference. When you do that, life automatically has meaning—to everyone.
