## Summary

## Key concepts

## Important quotes

- Building up the ability to tolerate the criticism that could be helpful and use it to your advantage while maintaining a sense of self-worth. Being open to learning from negative feedback that could help you make progress. Learning to let go of criticisms that reflect the values of someone else rather than your own. Ge ing clarity on which opinions ma er the most to you and why, so that it becomes easier to know when to reflect and learn and when to let go and move on.
- Confidence is not the same as comfortable. One of the biggest misconceptions about becoming self-confident is that it means living fearlessly. The key to building confidence is quite the opposite. It means we are willing to let fear be present as we do the things that matter to us. When we establish some self-confidence in something, it feels good. We want to stay there and hold on to it. But if we only go where we feel confident, then confidence never expands beyond that. If we only do the things we know we can do well, fear of the new and unknown tends to grow. Building confidence inevitably demands that we make friends with vulnerability because it is the only way to be without confidence for a while. But the only way confidence can grow is when we are willing to be without it. When we can step into fear and sit with the unknown, it is the courage of doing so that builds confidence from the ground up. Courage comes first, confidence comes second. This doesn’t mean that we have to dive in at the emotional deep end and risk overwhelming ourselves. To build confidence, we don’t have to live in fear. We have to develop a daily pattern of stepping into fear, sitting with it, and stepping back out, giving ourselves time to recover and replenish ready for tomorrow. Confidence cannot grow if we are never willing to be without it. To build confidence, go where you have none. Repeat every day and watch your confidence develop. Confidence is situation-specific, but what you keep as you move around is the belief that you can tolerate the fear as confidence grows. You do not need to overwhelm yourself with your worst-case scenario. Start with small changes. Along the way, be your own coach, not your worst critic. Courage comes before confidence.
- If you avoid the thing you fear, you never give yourself the chance to build up evidence in your mind that you can get through it and survive. Just telling your brain that something is safe is not enough. You must experience it.
- motivation is like a flame on a match. It will burn itself out. It’s an unsustainable source of fuel. But if you have a routine of small actions that are not too radical or dramatic to maintain, then your new sense of identity will help to sustain you.
- In a relationship or friendship, it is perfectly OK to disagree. You don’t have to be on the same page about everything all of the time. You are two different people, each with your own sensitivities, background experiences, needs, and coping mechanisms.

- Individuals were coming along to therapy believing that their strong painful emotions were the result of a fault in their brain or personality. They did not believe they had any power to influence them. While longer-term, more in-depth therapy is appropriate for some people, there were so many who simply needed some education about how their mind and body work and how they could manage their mental health day-to-day. I knew the catalyst was not me, it was the knowledge they were being introduced to. But people should not have to pay to come and see someone like me just to get access to that education about how their mind works. Sure, the information is out there. But in a sea of misinformation, you have to know what you are looking for.
- You cannot build a house with just one tool. Each task requires something slightly different. And however skilled you get at using those tools, some challenges are just much harder than others.
- Not all low mood is unidentified dehydration, but when dealing with mood it is essential to remember that it’s not all in your head. It’s also in your body state, your relationships, your past and present, your living conditions and lifestyle. It’s in everything you do and don’t do, in your diet and your thoughts, your movements and memories. How you feel is not simply a product of your brain.
- Low mood gives you the urge to do the things that make mood worse.
- The constant feedback between the brain, the body and our environment means that we can use those to influence how we feel.
- The first step to begin ge ing a grasp on low mood is to build our awareness of each aspect of the experience. This simply means noticing each one. This awareness starts o with hindsight. We look back on the day and choose moments to look at in detail. Then, with time and practice, that builds our ability to notice them in the moment.
- Once you get familiar with what is going on inside your own body and mind, you can then expand that awareness to looking at what is going on in your environment and your relationships and the impact that is having on your internal experience and behaviour. Take your time ge ing to know the details. When I am feeling this, what am I thinking about? When I am feeling this, what state is my body in? How was I looking a er myself in the days or hours leading up to this feeling? Is this an emotion or just physical discomfort from an unmet need? There are lots of questions. Sometimes the answers will be clear. Other times it will all feel too complex. That is OK. Continuing to explore and write down experiences will help to build up selfawareness about what makes things be er and what makes things worse.
- Having a grasp on what the people around us are thinking and feeling is crucial for humans. We live in groups and depend on each other, so we all spend much of our lives making guesses about what other people are thinking and feeling. But when we’re feeling down, we are more likely to assume that those guesses are true. ‘When my friend looked at me funny I just knew she hated me.’ But on a di erent day, when I’m not struggling with low mood, I might be more inclined to be a bit more curious about what was going on and possibly even ask her.
- When times are hard and you’re not feeling at your best, this tends to narrow our focus. It becomes more di cult to consider other people’s opinions and perspectives, or that they might hold di erent values. This bias can cause problems in our relationships
- Emotional reasoning tells you this means you must have failed. You may have performed OK in the exam, but your brain takes information from how you feel and you’re not feeling like a winner right now. The low mood could have been created by the stress followed by exhaustion, but the feeling is influencing how you then interpret your situation.
- Let’s say you post a picture on social media and plenty of your followers leave positive comments. But you are not looking for those. You skim past them, searching for any negative ones. If you find any, you might then spend a significant portion of your day thinking it over, feeling hurt, and doubting yourself. In evolutionary terms, it makes sense that when you feel vulnerable, you keep an extra lookout for signs of threat. But when you are trying to come back from a dark place, the mental filter is something to be aware of.
- if you feel you must never fail, you are se ing yourself up for a rollercoaster of emotions and a struggle with mood when you make a mistake or encounter a setback. We can strive for success and accept failures along the way. But when we set ourselves unrealistic expectations, we become trapped by them. That means we su er whenever there is any sign that we may not be living up to them. So watch out for those musts and shoulds. When you are already struggling with mood, expecting yourself to do, be and have everything that you are when you’re at your best is not realistic or helpful.
- Table of thought bias examples. THOUGHT BIAS WHAT IS IT? EXAMPLE Mind reading Making assumptions about what others are thinking and feeling. ‘She hasn’t called in a while because she hates me.’ Overgeneralization Taking one event and using it to generalize about other things. ‘I failed my exam. My future is ruined.’ Egocentric thinking Assuming that others have the same perspective and values as we have, and judging their behaviour through that lens. ‘I would never be late like that. He obviously doesn’t care enough about me.’ Emotional reasoning I feel it, therefore it must be true. ‘I feel guilty, therefore I am a bad parent.’ Musts and shoulds Relentless and unrealistic expectations that set us up to feel like a failure every day. ‘I must always look perfect.’ ‘I should never do any less than my absolute best.’ All-or-nothing thinking Thinking in absolutes or extremes. ‘If I don’t get 100 per cent I’m a failure.’ ‘If I don’t look perfect I’m not going out.’
- depressed brain is more likely to focus on the thought biases that can make you feel worse.
- Gratitude practice is another simple way to get used to turning your a ention. Find a small notebook and, once a day, write down three things that you feel grateful for. They can be something big like your loved ones, or it can be a small detail of your day that you appreciate, such as the taste of your co ee as you sit down to work. Now, this sounds almost too simple to be e ective, but every time you engage in gratitude, your brain is ge ing practice at turning its a ention to things that create pleasant emotional states. The more practice you get – the easier it becomes to use that in other situations.
- We cannot control the thoughts that pop into our minds, but we do have control of our spotlight of a ention. Trying not to think about something tends to make us think about it more. Allowing all thoughts to be present, but choosing which ones we give our time and a ention to, can have a powerful impact on our emotional experience. Turning our a ention is a skill that can be practised with both mindfulness and gratitude practice. While there is a time for focusing on a problem, we also need to focus on the direction we want to move in, and how we want to
- When it comes to tackling low mood, we have to focus on making good decisions, not perfect decisions. A good decision is one that moves you in the direction you want to go. It doesn’t have to catapult you there.
- But something we must do is keep making decisions, however small. In any survival situation, making decisions and moving is essential. If you find yourself in deep water in the dark, with no way of telling which direction leads to safety, what you do know is that if you don’t choose a direction and start moving, you won’t be able to keep your head above the surface for long. Low mood wants you to do nothing. Therefore, doing anything positive, however small, is a healthy step in the direction you want to go.
- When your mood is low and the small daily tasks feel like too much, don’t go se ing yourself extreme goals that feel out of reach. Pick one small change that you know you can action every day. Then make a promise to yourself that you will make it happen. It may seem silly at first, because those small changes won’t reward you with instant, drastic results. But they are doing something much more important. They are laying down the pathways for a new habit that you can integrate into your everyday life and build upon over time as it becomes second nature. So keep it small. Keep it consistent. Slow change is sustainable change.
- Focus on making good decisions, not perfect ones. ‘Good enough’ steers you towards real change. Perfectionism causes decision-making paralysis, whereas improving your mood demands that you make decisions and take action. Keep changes small and sustainable. When someone is down, we show them kindness because we know it is what they need. So, if you are commi ed to managing your mood and overall mental health, commit to practising self-compassion. Once you understand the problem, use it to help you work out where you want to go and focus on the horizon ahead of you.
- Exercise leads to higher circulating levels of dopamine as well as more available dopamine receptors in the brain (Olsen, 2011). This means it increases your capacity for pleasure in everyday life (McGonigal, 2019). So finding exercise you enjoy does not only o er you joy while you are exercising, but increases your sensitivity to find joy in all the other aspects of your life.
- Keep vigorous exercise to earlier in the day and try using the evenings for relaxation. A warm bath before bed can help your body reach a temperature that is optimal for sleep.
- We are much be er at problem-solving during the daylight hours, but if we push those problems away and ignore them, they tend to pop up at night when we are trying to sleep. So clear the desk and clear your mind as much as you can.
- You can’t force sleep. Making sleep happen is not something you can choose to do. Sleep happens when we create an environment in which the body and mind can feel safe and calm. So don’t concentrate on sleep, concentrate on relaxation, rest and calm. Your brain will do the rest.
- ‘What is one small change I could put in place today that would improve my nutritional intake?’ Then repeat this every day.
- Spending time with other people doesn’t mean we have to talk about how we feel. In fact, we don’t have to talk at all. Just be around people, watch them, smile at them. Share whatever conversation you can manage.
- Our mental health defence players provide the foundations of good health. When we nurture them daily they pay us back with interest. If you do one thing today, make it exercise. Choose something you enjoy and you increase your chances of keeping it going. The relationship between sleep and mental health works both ways. Prioritizing sleep will help your mental health, and making changes to your day will a ect your sleep. How you feed your brain influences how you feel. Traditional Mediterranean, Japanese and Norwegian diets show benefits for mental health. Human connection is a powerful tool for stress resilience. Your relationships change your biology and psychology.
- Motivation is not something you are born with. The feeling that you are energized and want to do something cannot be relied upon to always be there. Mastering motivation is building the capacity to do what ma ers most to you, even when a part of you does not feel like it. Procrastination is o en avoidance of stress or discomfort. Anhedonia is when we no longer get a sense of pleasure from the activities that we used to enjoy. This is o en associated with low mood and depression. If something ma ers to you and could benefit your health, don’t wait until you feel like it – do it anyway.
- But what if you have no motivation to exercise? Perhaps the key to making exercise a sustainable part of everyday life is to find a form of movement that you can begin even when your motivation is low. Research shows that doing even small amounts of exercise is be er than nothing, and anything more than your usual amount of movement will help boost your willpower (Barton & Pre y, 2010). Find something that feels easy. Something that brings you joy. Something that feels like precious time out rather than another boring job that has to get done. Add in friends, good music, and anything that helps you to look forward to it each day, rather than dread it.
- whatever change you are working on, increasing your level of activity, even in a small way, is a great way of strengthening your willpower to keep it up (McGonigal)
- Another big player in managing stress and the ability to make wise decisions is sleep. You only need one bad night’s sleep to struggle with increased stress, trouble concentrating and low mood the next day. Self-control takes energy and if you haven’t had enough sleep, your brain has less access to that energy and becomes more vulnerable to high stress reactions, squashing your capacity to control your actions.
- The best strategy for motivation is to take motivation out of the equation. There are things we do every day, whether we feel like it or not. For example, in the morning, you don’t ask yourself whether you have the motivation to clean your teeth, it’s just something you do. It is a habit so well-practised that you don’t need to think about it any more. You just do it. The reason for that is because it has been a nonnegotiable part of your daily routine for most of your life. Imagine your brain is like a jungle. For every action that you take, the brain has to make connections or pathways between different areas. When you repeat an action on a regular basis over a long period of time (like cleaning your teeth) those pathways become well-trodden and established. Those smooth, wide paths become easier to access so that your brain can do much of that action without you having to consciously think too much about it. But when you start something new you have to carve out a fresh path, sometimes from scratch. That takes huge amounts of conscious effort. And if you don’t use that path o en enough, it will always be effortful. Any time that you are under stress your brain will automatically choose the easiest route, which is the path well-trodden. But if you can repeat that new behaviour as o en as you can, for enough times, then a new habit is established and becomes easier to use when you most need it.
- Here are a few tips on how to establish a new habit: Make the new behaviour as easy as possible to do, especially in moments when you might not feel like taking action. Set up your environment in a way that supports your new change of behaviour. In the early stages of the change, you cannot rely on habit. Make clear plans and set reminders if necessary. Add in a mix of short-term and longer-term rewards. Internal rewards work be er than external ones. So we don’t need trophies as much as we need that internal celebration and acknowledgement that we are on the right track. Get clarity on why you are making this change and why it matters so much to you. You can use the values exercises in this book to help with that (see page 286). Establish this change as a part of your identity. This is how you do things now.
- As previously mentioned, we can also practise gratitude in a more formal way by sitting down with pen and paper and writing down the things that we feel grateful for each day. When we do that, we are turning our attention on purpose in a way that shi s our emotional state. But it is not only that immediate impact on our emotions that we gain. When we practise gratitude on a regular basis we are repeating an action. As described previously, the more we repeat an action the easier it becomes for the brain to do it with less effort in the future. Almost like a mental muscle, putting the reps in each day makes it much easier to think in a helpful way when we might need to in the future.
- if you want to get up on time every day, put the alarm clock just outside your room so that you have no choice but to get up. If you can anticipate the situations that may be difficult and have a plan in place to deal with them, you won’t have to think on your feet and wrestle with temptation or motivation at a time when you may feel vulnerable.
- Toolkit: Future self-memory and journalling improves your chance of making be er choices Spend time imagining your future. When we create a vivid image of ourselves in the future, the easier it becomes to make choices in the here and now that will benefit your future (Peters & Buchel, 2010). Think about yourself at a point in the future and how you might feel about the choices you have made, what you said yes to and what you said no to. How will those choices have affected your life? Which of your choices and actions do you think you will be most proud of? When you reach that time in the future, what will you be focusing on? How will you feel about your past self when you look back?
- Try this: Building on your identity with intention takes some thought and conscious effort. Try sitting down with pen and paper to write out some answers to these questions. Be er still, use a journal and keep coming back to your responses whenever you are working on a life change. What is the larger overall change that I am trying to make? Why is this change so important to me? What kind of person do I want to be as I face this challenge? How could I approach this challenge in a way that would make me feel proud when I look back on this period of my life, regardless of the outcome? What are those smaller goals that I need to achieve along the way? How would I like to face those days when motivation is low? Am I listening to my body and what it needs?
- We cannot rely on motivation to be there all the time. We can practise acting in opposition to urges so that we can act in line with our values rather than how we feel right now. Repeat a new behaviour enough times and it will become habit. For any big goal, rest and replenishment along the way is vital – just ask any elite athlete. Make use of small rewards along the way.
- You cannot change what you cannot make sense of.
- Albert Einstein reportedly once said, ‘If I had an hour to solve a problem, I’d spend fi y-five minutes thinking about the problem and five minutes thinking about solutions.’ This quote o en comes to mind when I hear the common misconception that therapy consists of sitting in a room and dwelling on your problems. It does involve thinking about your problems, but there is method in that. The most effective way to resolve a problem is to understand the problem inside out.
- Wouldn’t it be great if we could wake up in the morning and just decide what to feel that day? Enter love, excitement and joy, please! Unfortunately it is not so simple. The opposite of this idea is that emotions just pop up, with no trigger, and we have no control over what happens or when it happens. All we can do is try to resist them, block them out and be rational. But this is also not the case. While we cannot directly trigger all emotions, we have much more influence over our emotional state than we were ever taught to believe. This does not mean that you are to blame for feeling emotional discomfort. It means that we get to learn about the many ways we can take responsibility for our own wellbeing and construct new emotional experiences.
- Imagine you are at the beach. You walk into the sea up to your chest. The waves need to pass over you to get to the shore. If you try to hold the waves back and prevent them reaching the shore, you learn how powerful those waves are. They push you back and you quickly get engulfed and overwhelmed. But you don’t have to tumble and struggle against the waves. Those waves are coming no ma er what. When you accept that, you can focus on keeping your head above the water as it passes. You still feel the effects. Might even get li ed o your feet for a moment. But you move with the water and brace yourself ready to land back on your feet. Dealing with emotion is much the same as standing in the waves. When we try to stop feelings in their tracks, we easily get knocked o our feet and find ourselves in trouble, struggling to catch a breath and work out which way is up. When we allow the emotion to wash over us, it rises, peaks and descends, taking its natural course.
- You are not your feelings and your feelings are not who you are. The
- Some words for emotions have gradually been used more and more to mean different things, until they have taken on broad and vague meanings. ‘Happy’ has become an umbrella term for anything positive, to the extent that nobody really knows if what they are feeling qualifies as ‘happy’. If I feel passionate, am I happy? If I feel calm and content, am I happy? If I feel inspired and energized, is that happy? The same has happened to words like depression. What is a depressed mood, exactly? Sadness? Emptiness? Agitation? Numbness? Uneasiness? Restlessness? Flatness?
- The more new words you can build up to differentiate between feelings, the more options your brain has for making sense of various sensations and emotions. When you have a more accurate word for a feeling, this helps to regulate your emotions and in turn means less stress for your body and mind overall. This is a crucial tool if you want to be more flexible and effective in how you respond to challenges that you face (Feldman Barre , 2017). The good news is that this is a skill we can all keep building upon. Here are some ideas for how to build up your emotional vocabulary. Get specific. When you feel something, try to go beyond ‘I feel awesome,’ or ‘I’m not happy.’ What other words can you use to describe this feeling? Is it a combination of feelings? What physical sensations do you notice? One emotion label may not be enough to encapsulate this feeling. Is it a combination of feelings? For example, ‘I feel nervous and also excited.’
- Chapter summary The language we use has a powerful effect on our experience of the world. The more words you have to describe how you feel, the be er. If you don’t have the words you can use something like the Feeling Wheel to give you prompts. Notice the words others use, read books and explore the ways you can keep building your emotional vocabulary.
- CHAPTER 13 How to support someone
- Supporting someone does not mean that you have to connect with big, intense conversations. Human connection in the smallest of moments matters. Walking while you are talking can help those who feel uncomfortable with opening up. You can also say nothing at all. Simply spending time together, even in silence,
- Listen carefully. Don’t o er advice unless they ask for it. Just reflect back what you hear them saying; let them know they are being heard and respected.
- Chapter summary It is normal to feel overwhelmed or inadequate when supporting someone with mental health problems. You want to fix it but you don’t know how. Leaning in to support someone who is suffering can be stressful as you don’t want to say the wrong thing. But don’t avoid them. You don’t have to fix everything to be a great support. Look a er yourself to prevent burnout. Get your own support and set clear boundaries. Never underestimate the power of listening.
- Regular exercise, eating well and ensuring we maintain some social contact will all help us to strengthen our mental health when we most need it.
- CHAPTER 18 Dealing with criticism and disapproval
- We develop our sense of self and identity, not only from our own experience and how we interact with others, but also through what we imagine those other people really think of us, the ideas and perceptions they might have of us. This is called the ‘looking glass self’ (Cooley, 1902). So it makes sense that what I believe you think of me is going to influence what I do next.
- The tasks of dealing with criticism: Building up the ability to tolerate the criticism that could be helpful and use it to your advantage while maintaining a sense of self-worth. Being open to learning from negative feedback that could help you make progress. Learning to let go of criticisms that reflect the values of someone else rather than your own. Ge ing clarity on which opinions ma er the most to you and why, so that it becomes easier to know when to reflect and learn and when to let go and move on.
- CHAPTER 19 The key to building confidence
- Confidence is like a home that you build for yourself. When you go somewhere new, you must build a new one. But when we do, we’re not starting from scratch. Every time we step into the unknown and try something new, experience that vulnerability, make mistakes, get through them and build some confidence, we move on to the next chapter with evidence that we can get through tough challenges. We bring with us the courage we need to take that leap of faith again and again. That same leap of faith the trapeze artist must take every time she lets go of one bar before grabbing the next one. She is always vulnerable, never completely safe, but each time she tries, she knows she can meet that risk with the courage needed to make it happen.
- Confident is not the same as comfortable. One of the biggest misconceptions about becoming self-confident is that it means living fearlessly. The key to building confidence is quite the opposite. It means we are willing to let fear be present as we do the things that ma er to us. When we establish some self-confidence in something, it feels good. We want to stay there and hold on to it. But if we only go where we feel confident, then confidence never expands beyond that. If we only do the things we know we can do well, fear of the new and unknown tends to grow. Building confidence inevitably demands that we make friends with vulnerability because it is the only way to be without confidence for a while. But the only way confidence can grow is when we are willing to be without it. When we can step into fear and sit with the unknown, it is the courage of doing so that builds confidence from the ground up. Courage comes first, confidence comes second. This doesn’t mean that we have to dive in at the emotional deep end and risk overwhelming ourselves.
- To build confidence, we don’t have to live in fear. We have to develop a daily pattern of stepping into fear, si ing with it, and stepping back out, giving ourselves time to recover and replenish ready for tomorrow.
- Professional athletes have professional coaches for a reason. In day-to-day life we don’t have that, so we must be that voice for ourselves. The natural emotional response to failure influences our thoughts and makes us more vulnerable to self-criticism. So we can’t always stop it, but we can respond to it with an alternative that serves us be er. To build confidence, you have to get to work being your own coach instead of your own worst critic. That includes responding to failure in a way that will help you to get up, dust yourself o and get back out there. A professional coach would not bully you with words, or chant affirmations that you couldn’t believe in. They bring honesty, accountability, unconditional encouragement and support. They are in your corner, whatever the score, with your best interests at heart. Doing that for yourself is not always easy, but is a life skill that we can improve on with practice.
- Chapter summary Confidence cannot grow if we are never willing to be without it. To build confidence, go where you have none. Repeat every day and watch your confidence develop. Confidence is situation-specific, but what you keep as you move around is the belief that you can tolerate the fear as confidence grows. You do not need to overwhelm yourself with your worst-case scenario. Start with small changes. Along the way, be your own coach, not your worst critic. Courage comes before confidence.
- CHAPTER 20 You are not your mistakes
- CHAPTER 22 Make anxiety disappear!
- CHAPTER 23 Things we do that make anxiety worse
- If you avoid the thing you fear, you never give yourself the chance to build up evidence in your mind that you can get through it and survive. Just telling your brain that something is safe is not enough. You must experience it.
- Toolkit: Square breathing Step 1. Focus your gaze on something square: a nearby window, door, picture frame or computer screen. Step 2. Focus your eyes on the bo om le -hand corner and as you breathe in, count to 4 and trace your eyes up to the top corner. Step 3. Hold your breath for 4 seconds as you trace your eyes across the top to the other corner. Step 4. As you breathe out, trace your eyes down to the bo om corner, counting to 4 once again. Step 5. Hold for 4 seconds as you move back to the bo om le corner to start again. So, you breathe in for 4 seconds, hold for 4 seconds, out for 4 seconds and hold for 4 seconds. Focusing on something square can act as a guide and help you to keep your a ention on the breathing, minimizing the chances of being distracted too soon. If you try it for a few minutes and feel like it’s not working yet, keep going. It takes some time for your body to respond.
- If you have a stressful day, try adding in a short jog outside, or an intense half hour with a punch bag. Physical movement will truly relieve your body of the physical stress so that when you sit down to relax, you can feel calm and fall asleep more easily, helping you to replenish further.
- Personalizing Personalizing is when we have some limited or ambiguous information about the world and make it about us. For example, I’m walking down the street and see a friend on the other side of the road. I call her name and wave, but she doesn’t wave back. Immediately, my personalizing thoughts tell me that she must hate me. I must have said something to o end her. Maybe all our friends have been talking about me and I thought I had friends but now I have none.
- Mental filter The mental filter is that tendency for us to hold on to all the information that makes us feel worse, and neglect all the information that could help us feel di erently. Let’s say you post something on social media and you get fi y comments. Forty-nine of those comments are positive and encouraging. One is negative and points out something that you already felt insecure about. The mental filter is when we focus our a ention on that one negative comment and neglect to consider the other forty-nine. The mental filter was definitely at play when I focused in on the fact that the Leaning Tower of Pisa was leaning and failed to consider that it has remained standing for hundreds of years and has a large team of professionals constantly monitoring its safety.
- Overgeneralizing Overgeneralizing is when we take one experience and apply it to all experiences. If you interview for a job and get turned down, overgeneralizing thoughts would sound like, ‘I’m never going to get a job, so what’s the point of applying for anything else?’ or a er a breakup, ‘I screw up every relationship so I’m not going to date ever again.’ Overgeneralizing makes anxiety worse for a couple of reasons. It leads to a more intense spike of emotion because it turns one problem into a bigger, life problem. Secondly, it o en leads us to avoid the situation in the future, which feeds anxiety and makes it much harder to face.
- Labelling Labelling is similar to overgeneralizing but involves taking one event or period of time and using that to make global judgements about who you are as a person. If you experience a period of anxiety in your life, and from that point label yourself as an anxious person, you start to form a concept for your self and your identity which then impacts on how you expect to feel and behave in the future. Each emotion, behaviour and period in our lives is temporary and not necessarily a reflection of who we are permanently. So, when you notice that you are labelling yourself as a certain type of person, don’t let it go unchecked. Doing so has an impact on the emotions that are constructed by your brain in the future. Instead, acknowledging the specifics of the experience as a temporary one helps to distance you as a person from the experiences that you encounter along the way. It’s much harder to change an identity as an anxious person than it is to simply reduce anxiety.
- compassion is not always the easy thing. It is not saying there is nothing to be scared of. It is the coach in your ear with a calm and firm voice that is encouraging you, supporting you, reminding you that you can and will move through this moment.
- He told me to try and enjoy the exam. He told me that this was an opportunity to show o everything I had learned and worked on during these years of training. He said this was the one and only time that anyone would read the entirety of my thesis and show genuine interest in it, so it was my chance to enjoy sharing that interest. I returned to the waiting room nodding and smiling. What I didn’t recognize until I was on safer ground was how he had helped me to reframe the entire experience. Nothing changed about the high-pressure situation I was facing. But I went from a rabbit in headlights to creating an experience that included a mix of courage, pleasure and excitement.

- experiencing stress is not just an indication of problems or warning signs for health issues. It can also reflect a life in which we are acting on things that we care greatly about and living a life with purpose and meaning. If we can learn how to use it to our advantage, and turn down the intensity when we need to, then stress can be our most valuable tool.
- How we think about stress e ects how we perform under pressure. Seeing stress as an asset that will help you enables you to spend less energy trying to squash the feelings and instead focus on the demands you face. Keep performance a rmations or mantras focused on what to do, rather than what not to do. Adjust your focus to adjust your stress levels. Work on your relationship to failure and building shame resilience to help you deal with stress in high-pressure situations.
- There are some simple exercises you can do to get some clarity on your values as they are today. It’s worth noting that values change over time depending on our stage in life and what we are facing. Not only do our values change but so do our actions and their alignment to those values. Life happens, and when we face change or struggle, we can be pulled in a new direction away from what ma ers. So it’s helpful to make time for a values check-in every now and then to re-evaluate. It’s a way of checking the compass and the map at the same time. Which way am I heading? Do I want to be going in this direction? If not, how can I adjust my direction to head back towards what ma ers most to me? Figure 10: Values – circle the values that feel relevant and important to you.
- if you identify that looking a er your health and looking a er your body is of the highest importance to you at 10 out of 10, but you rate how much you are living in line with that as just 2 out of 10 because you have been eating poorly and stopped exercising, then that gives you a prompt to look at making some positive changes in that area of your life.
- You’ll find blank values stars that you can fill in at the back of the book in the spare tools section.
- motivation is like a flame on a match. It will burn itself out. It’s an unsustainable source of fuel. But if you have a routine of small actions that are not too radical or dramatic to maintain, then your new sense of identity will help to sustain you.
- Be as one. In a relationship or friendship, it is perfectly OK to disagree. You don’t have to be on the same page about everything all of the time. You are two di erent people, each with your own sensitivities, background experiences, needs and coping mechanisms.
- If you truly open up and connect with another person, you will undoubtedly discover parts of them that you need to tolerate and accept in order to nurture the relationship over a lifetime. Be together always. Whether it’s a friendship or intimate relationship, it is OK to enjoy spending time apart. You do not have to become two parts of the same person. You are two separate and unique individuals and to nurture the aspects of yourself that make you di erent does not need to threaten the relationship. This relationship myth compounds our fears of abandonment and prevents many people from allowing their partners or themselves to develop and grow as individuals within a relationship. When we feel secure in a relationship, we can feel more free to be separate people and not feel threatened by the other aspects of our partner’s life.
- Relationship success means staying together at all costs. Relationships have a potent e ect on our health and happiness, but merely having a relationship is not enough. If relationships are to have a positive impact on our lives, then this means working to improve the quality of those connections and making careful, intentional choices about them too. While we can take full responsibility for ourselves, we cannot force change upon another. It is OK to end a relationship that causes harm to your physical or mental wellbeing. I have included in the resources section information on services that provide support to anyone who feels unsafe in a relationship.
- Creating anything that is long-lasting is not about one big grand gesture that will make everything OK. It is about making those seemingly small everyday choices conscious and intentional. It is about reliably and consistently trying to navigate towards your values. The way to ensure that your everyday actions are led by intention, rather than reactive, is to step back every now and then and reflect on how you want the picture to look.
- Relationships researcher John Go man (Go man & Silver, 1999) suggests that for both men and women the overriding factor that determines how satisfied they feel in their relationship (by 70 per cent) is the quality of their friendship. So actively focusing on how to develop friendship and working on what it takes to be a be er friend is a good idea. When we work on building the quality of friendship, we might do that by regularly enjoying each other’s company and working hard to maintain mutual compassion and respect for each other, ge ing to know each other in the finest detail, finding ways to express appreciation and care in everyday life. The more of life we can fill with closeness and experiences that strengthen friendship, the more protection the relationship has against the inevitable hurdles that come in the form of disagreements, stressful life events and losses. It is much easier to ride the waves of life’s ups and downs if we are well-practised at pulling together and have built up deep respect and gratitude for each other.

- Respectful complaining: Most people have an idea of what type of feedback helps them to take a message on board and learn, and what type of feedback puts them in a shame spiral. When we play the blame game, nobody wins. Building a healthy relationship is not about le ing go of your own needs to please another, but it does demand that we use the compassion and care that we would want to receive when we tackle frustrations and problems.
